<p>Piotr Rabiniak asked question about <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a> at .NET Developers Poland facebook group. Lot of people replied, that they are using it. So do I. Usually using <a title="My Pomidoro Windows 8 app is getting famous" href="http://jj09.net/my-pomidoro-windows-8-app-is-getting-famous/">my Pomidoro Windows 8 app</a>. I don't use Pomodoro Technique everyday, but there are two main scenarios, when I find it extremely useful:</p>
<ol>
<li>At work, when I have many interesting things to check out (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Blogs, etc.). After first Pomodoro, I am in the flow, focused on work. Then I continue and after 4-6 pomodoros lot of things are done.</li>
<li>At home (after work), when I want to play with some new technology or do some programming. There is also a lot of distractions, but this time it is worse. After I check all tweets, facebook, news, recent developers conferences, it is 10pm. Then I work till midnight or 1am, and do not have time to rest before the next day. For that, I created a rule: I can spend 4 pomodoros after work. No more, no less. It helps a lot! I come back home, eat dinner, start 4 pomodoros around 8pm, and at 10pm I am done. Additionally, even if it wasn't enough to accomplish everything I wanted, my excitement level for next day is higher.</li>
</ol>
<p>For me, Pomodoro Technique is not a way for living, but sometimes is extremely helpful. The magic happens, because it is only 25 minutes. It is not a lot, but it is enough to get into the flow. And after that you can have a 5 minutes break. In my case, the hardest thing is start working. After I dive in...everything is easy :)</p>
<p>There are many Pomodoro apps. I use <a href="http://appcrawlr.com/ios/simple-pomodoro-timer">one on my iPhone</a> and <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/pomidoro/63bde253-b627-44ec-884e-59e17af7a918">my Pomidoro app for Windows 8</a>.</p>
