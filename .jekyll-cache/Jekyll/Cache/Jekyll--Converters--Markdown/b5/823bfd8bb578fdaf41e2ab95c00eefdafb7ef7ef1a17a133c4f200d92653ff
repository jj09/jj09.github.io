<p>Six years ago I purchased <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16823126022">Logitech UltraX</a>, which is still the best keyboard I have ever had. Unfortunately, as you know, keyboard cannot live for ever. Two years ago I wanted to buy the same model again, but...<a href="http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Keyboards-and-Keyboard-Mice/UltraX-no-longer-made-Alternatives/td-p/791803">UltraX is no longer made</a>. I was looking for some on amazon and ebay, and I found only <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Logitech-Ultra-X-PS-2-Keyboard-Silver-Black-Single-NEW-/150373316730">Logitech Ultra X with PS/2</a>. I bought it and it was fine, but I needed also PS/2-&gt;USB converter (my laptop doesn't have PS/2 like most of laptops today). It works fine, but sometimes it loses connection. Only solution I found is to disconnect and insert it again into the USB port.</p>

<p>Recently I split a tea on the keyboard and keys are not working very well anymore. Thus I needed a new one. I wanted to buy the same model. It was <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Logitech-Ultra-X-PS-2-Keyboard-Silver-Black-Single-NEW-/150373316730">still available on eBay</a>, but I found <a href="http://www.silentpcreview.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=61769">this discussion</a>, where one guy recommended <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/k750-keyboard">Logitech K750</a>. Its price is around $60 (too much), but I found refurbished for $30 (acceptable) and I bought it.</p>

<p>After a month, I can say that I am satisfied. It is wireless, but works smoothly (almost like wired). I didn't have any communication issues so far. The cool thing is the fact that it doesn't have replaceable batteries. It charges itself through solar panels. Additionally Logitech provides <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/articles/solar-app">Solar App</a>, which shows the battery condition and how much 'light power' is it getting from the light/sun. The two screenshots below shows Solar App when light is turned on (left) and turned off (right).</p>

</div>
<p>The most important capability: keys. They are nice, low profiled, but a bit loose and loud. It doesn't bother me though. I can say that K750 is a one class lower than <a href="https://www.apple.com/keyboard/">Apple Keyboard</a>, which I was using for 2 months in last summer (working on Mac). I would purchase Apple keyboard (better keys), if it would have 'Windows' version. For now, I am satisfied with K750.</p>
<p>If you are looking for UltraX-like keyboard, then K750 is definitely worth to consider!</p>
