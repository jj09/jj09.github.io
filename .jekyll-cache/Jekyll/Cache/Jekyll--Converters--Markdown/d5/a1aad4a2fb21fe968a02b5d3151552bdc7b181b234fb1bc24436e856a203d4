I"<p>Recently I got a Surface Book 2. From the beginning, my battery icon was missing, and I spent hours researching how to fix it.Â I didn't even have battery show up in device manager.</p>
<p>To save you hours, here is the solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to device manager</li>
<li>View -&gt; show hidden devices<br />

<li>Uninstall <strong>Surface Serial Hub Driver</strong>:<br />

<li>uninstall all other devices that have warnings*</li>
<li>reboot and wait a few minutes for missing drivers to get reinstalled</li>
</ol>
<p>(*) - I am not 100% sure step 4 is required, but it won't hurt and it may help.</p>
<p>After that you should get your battery status back:</p>

<p>It should also be visible in device manager now:</p>
