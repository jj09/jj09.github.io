I"<p>Once again I had a pleasure to join Scott Hanselman on Azure Friday. In the past we did a video about <a href="https://jj09.net/azure-mobile-app-on-azure-friday/">Azure Mobile App</a>. This time we talked about Azure Search.</p>
<p>Azure Friday is very casual. You just walk in, and chat with Scott. It just happen to be recorded :D</p>
<p>In this week's episode we did a quick overview of Azure Search capabilities. Service, on which, I was working on for last two years.</p>
