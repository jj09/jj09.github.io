I"±<p>June was a month of conferences for .NET developers! We had <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013">Tech Ed North America</a>, <a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/">Norwegian Developers Conference</a>, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Europe/2013">Tech Ed Europe</a> and bunch more, but the biggest one was <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">Microsoft Build Developer Conference</a>.</p>
<p>All videos are live and available for free on <a href="channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013">Channel 9</a>. Both Keynotes are worth to see, but for .NET people second day's keynote would be more interesting. I also recommend <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a>'s session <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/2-546">Whatâ€™s New in ASP.NET and Visual Studio 2013</a>. Scott shows lots of nice new features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>One ASP.NET</li>
<li>Bootstrap as default template in ASP.NET project</li>
<li>Multiple default browsers in Visual Studio</li>
<li>Real-Time website refreshing between Visual Studio and Browser (without page reloading)</li>
<li>New ninja snippets</li>
<li>and much, much more</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also very solid session <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/2-509">Introduction to Node.js on Windows Azure</a> by <a href="http://tomasz.janczuk.org/">Tomasz Janczuk</a>. I really enjoyed this session. Tomasz shows Node.js basics, and how to it on Windows Azure in very simple and clear way.</p>
<p>Third must see (if you are .NET dev) is <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-503">Visual Studio 2013 for Web Developers: Deep Dive</a> by Mads Kristensen. Mads shows hot new features in VS editors (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and WebEssentials add-on.</p>
