<p>Making your website secure has never been easier!Â I was able to take myÂ WordPress blog to HTTPS in less than 10 minutes!</p>
<h3>CloudFlare</h3>
<p>This part is super easy and straight-forward. Just sign up for <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a>, go toÂ <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/a/add-site">cloudflare.com/a/add-site</a> and follow instructions. You can also check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbHN2sk3JjQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2774">this Troy Hunt's demo</a> to see it in action.</p>
<p>Once you finish, your website will be running on HTTPS!</p>
<p>Additional benefit is taking advantage of CloudFlare cache! For free! As you can see on the below screenshot, in last month: 54/66 GB was served from CloudFlare, only 11/66 GB came from my server!</p>

<h3>WordPress</h3>
<p>If you have WordPress blog (like I do), above setup will take your website to HTTPS, but all urls (hyperlinks, images, stylesheets etc.) will be still HTTP. This will result in <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/fixing-mixed-content">mixed content error</a>.</p>
<p>I love WordPress because every problem you may have was already solved by somebody else :) In this case problem is solved by <a href="https://jonnyjordan.com/blog/how-to-setup-cloudflare-flexible-ssl-for-wordpress/">CloudFlare Flexible SSL Plugin</a>.</p>
<h3>Multiple domains</h3>
<p>If you have multiple domains pointing to your blog, things are a little bit more complicated: <a href="http://www.itworld.com/article/2936598/servers/wordpress-multisite-ssl-with-domain-mapping-using-cloudflare.html">Wordpress Multisite SSL with domain mapping using Cloudflare </a>.</p>

It is also worth to remember that <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/i-wanna-go-fast-https-massive-speed-advantage/">HTTPS might be faster than HTTP</a>!</p>
