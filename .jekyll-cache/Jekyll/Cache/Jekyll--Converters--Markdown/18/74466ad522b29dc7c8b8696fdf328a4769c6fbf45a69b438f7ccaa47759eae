<p>During the work on Azure Portal I spent quite a bit of time on ensuring rich keyboard support.Â ThisÂ requires appropriateÂ focus management. When user press some keyboard shortcut, the focus should move to appropriate element.Â There is a good article on MDN about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Keyboard-navigable_JavaScript_widgets">Keyboard-navigable JavaScript widgets</a>. Focus behavior should be also testedÂ very succinctly. As it is very easy to change (break) with even the smallest change in the HTML or JavaScript.</p>
<p>Standard test goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrange: open someÂ page</li>
<li>Act: execute some keyboard shortcut that should open particular page and/or set focus on particular element</li>
<li>Assert: check if expected element is focused</li>
</ul>

<p>The simplest way is to use jQuery:</p>
