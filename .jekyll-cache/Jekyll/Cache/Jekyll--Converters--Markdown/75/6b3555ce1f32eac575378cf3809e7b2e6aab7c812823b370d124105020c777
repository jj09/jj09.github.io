<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Soft-Skills-software-developers-manual/dp/1617292397">Soft Skills: The Software Developer's Life Manual</a> by <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/">Jon Sonmez</a> is a great set of advises about every aspect of programmer's career and life. Take a look at the book content:</p>
<ol>
<li>Career</li>
<li>Marketing yourself</li>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>Productivity</li>
<li>Financial</li>
<li>Fitness</li>
<li>Spirit</li>
</ol>
<p>This book is not a source of truth for everything, but it may give you useful ideas for some particular aspects of your career and life. John is explaining that programmer's career is not only about coding. I especially like the fact that this book is not only about the work/career oriented things, but it puts work and life together. John explains the importance of living a healthy life (exercise and diet), and how this will help you with your career. He also showcases how to manage your finances throughout your career, and the importance of thinking "long term".</p>
