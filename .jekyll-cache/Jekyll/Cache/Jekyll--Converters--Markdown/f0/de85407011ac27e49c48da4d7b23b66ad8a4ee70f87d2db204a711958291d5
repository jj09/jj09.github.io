<p>Recently I read 3 books written by founders of <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> (formerly 37 Signals):Â <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> (creator of Ruby on Rails framework) and <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried">Jason Fried</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a></li>
<li><a href="http://37signals.com/rework/">Rework</a></li>
<li><a href="http://37signals.com/remote/">Remote: Office not required</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Getting Real was written almost 10 years ago, and it talks about the same things as most recentÂ Remote. So you can skip it. However Rework, and Remote are definitely worth to read.Â They present the new(?) approach for work, and productivity.</p>
<p>Rework focuses on pragmatic ways to improve your (and your company) productivity.</p>
<p>Remote presents how remote working can be appliedÂ in your company. All Basecamp employees are remote workers. My key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>working remotely helps to better manage interruptions (nobody is going to step by with "quick question")</li>
<li>you can manage your hours more flexibly: workout in the middle of the day? no problem</li>
<li>you live pretty much everywhere, and save up a lot of time on daily commute</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course authors present ideasÂ that works for them, and mayÂ not necessary work for you. However, I am sure you will appreciateÂ more than one of their advises.</p>
<p>This is one of my favorites quotes from Remote:</p>

<p>As a teaser you can watch Jason Fried's Ted talk: <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jason_fried_why_work_doesn_t_happen_at_work">Why work doesn't happen at work</a>. I also recommend David's talk:Â <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlhAkNWC1qo">Unlearn Your MBA</a> (fromÂ Stanford University).</p>
<p>Both Rework, and Remote goes to <a title="Books I like" href="http://jj09.net/books/">my favorite books list</a>.</p>
