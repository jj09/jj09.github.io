I"Ì<p>I published a <a href="http://jj09.net/tools/">list of tools</a> I use everyday. Maybe someone will find something what is useful for him, but never heard about.</p>
<p>I will try to keep it up to date and it will be always accessible through <a href="http://jj09.net/tools">http://jj09.net/tools</a>.</p>
<p>Not all tools are multi-platform. For now, the list is only for Windows. Maybe sometime in the future I will publish also "Mac Specific" tools.</p>
