I"Y<p>On July 1st I had a pleasure to speak at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Node-js/">Seattle Node.js meetup</a>Â about unit testing and Test Driven Development with Angular.js and Node.js, using TypeScript.</p>
<p>In this talk I gave an overview of JavaScript testing frameworks, and tools. I also demonstrated how TypeScript can strengthen your tests by adding free unit tests (type checking) thanks to strong typing.</p>
