<p>Agile teams usually works in the Open Spaces. This makes communication easier, but it also introduces a problem: it is easier to interrupt your coworker. We all know what interruption means for programmer:</p>

<p>Some people (e.g., DHH or Joel Spolsky) argue that working in Open Space is not good idea at all. They even wrote about that in their books:</p>

<p>Here are three tips that can help you to fix this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>When you want to ask somebody about something, <strong>send an email, or instant message instead of talking to him</strong> (even, and especially, when he sits next to you).</li>
<li><strong>Keep headphones on all the time when you working</strong>. Even if you are not listening to anything. This will make others to hesitate more before talking to you.</li>
<li>Convince everybody from your team to apply tip 1 and 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>I recommend you to check Michal Sliwon's blog entry: <a href="http://blog.mihcall.com/2014/05/11/Asynchronous-communication-at-work/">Asynchronous communication at work</a>, where you can find even more tips. It is also worth to read books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Remote-Office-Required-Jason-Fried/dp/0804137501">Remote</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Gets-Things-Done-Technical/dp/1590598385">Smart and Gets Things Done</a> (you can find them on <a href="http://jj09.net/books/">my favorite books list</a>). Both are against working in Open Spaces. First - is favoring working remotely. Second - private offices. Nevertheless, it is surprising how many ideas from these books - applied in remote work, and private office environments - can also works in Open Spaces.</p>
<p>Are you working in Open Space? What are you doing to be productive?</p>
