<p>It is amazing how big progress was made in embedded systems recently. I remember when I had microcontrollers class at Wroclaw University of Technology (about 3 years ago) and we were programming in Assembly. When I heard (3 years ago) that the main language for programming microcontrollers is C++ I was so excited. It would be so much easier than in Assembly. Now (3 years later), I started working on my Master Thesis at Kansas State University. The ultimate goal is to create prototype of medical device using embedded computer <a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBoard-xM">BeagleBoard XM</a>.</p>
<p>This board has 1GHz ARM processor (Cortex-A8), 512MB RAM, 4 USB ports and even HDMI output. Moreover, it has MicroSD slot which allows you to run Linux or Android Operating system!</p>

<p>There is also Ethernet port, which allows to update the Operating System without any external PC. The key part of the device is set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation">PWM</a> pins, which will allow me to control the medical device engine.</p>
<p>I will use Ada programming language with <a href="http://www.embedded-news.tv/component/resource/article/1-all-videos/519">cross-compiler from AdaCore</a>. However you can install Java VM and run Java programs if you want! It blows my mind! Programming microcontrollers in Java (the very high-level programming language) instead of doing it in Assembly.</p>
<p>The cost of this Board is $149, which is another advantage of this device.</p>
<p>More info about the board can be found <a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBoard-xM">here</a>.<br />
It usually comes along with MicroSD card and Angstrom Linux on it. Additionally, you can find Angstrom images <a href="http://angstrom.s3.amazonaws.com/demo/beagleboard/index.html">here</a>. To update existing installation (of Angstrom) just do </p>
<p><code>opkg update<br />
opkg upgrade</code></p>
