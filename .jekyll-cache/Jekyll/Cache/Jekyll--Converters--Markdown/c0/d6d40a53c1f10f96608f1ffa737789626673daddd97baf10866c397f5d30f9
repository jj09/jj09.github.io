<p>Is your <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/28888194?shelf=to-read">"to read" backlog</a> longer than 100 books? Is there more books than you can read in one year? Mine too!</p>
<p>Solution? Pick top 20, and remove the rest?</p>
<p>That's one way to go, but there is also another one: speed reading.</p>
<p>I decided to learn a little about speed reading in order to get to some books that I'm curious about, but...not enough to devote a month of reading for them. There are some books I just want to just know what's in there.</p>
<p>Speed reading is also useful for articles. How many times your friends send you things that take 20 minutes to read, and then you are like "meh...I wish I spent this time by going for a walk"?</p>
<p>How many times you decided that you want toÂ read something because you are very interested in particular topic? How many times you ended up in reading it, and concluding:Â <em>"if I could go back in time I wouldn't read it"</em> or <em>"content was not what I was expecting"</em>? How many times you read something and you think: <em>"Yeah, it's good, but it can be summarized in 1 paragraph"</em>?</p>
<h3>Resources to get started</h3>

<h3>My approach</h3>
<p>When I see something that interests me I do not read it from back to back anymore. I skim first, and if it's good I read it more carefully, or do another, more comprehensive skim. If it's a book, I read table of contents first.</p>
<p>Sometimes I also read summary at <a href="http://www.wikisummaries.org">wikisummaries</a>, <a href="https://fourminutebooks.com">fourminutebooks</a> or <a href="https://www.blinkist.com/">blinkist</a>.</p>
<p>Another heuristic that helps me to make a decision about reading books is to check GoodReads score. If it's above 4 then it's promising. Around 4.5 usually end up being very good, worth reading back to back.</p>
<p>For storytelling books, like biographies, I usually pick up an audiobook on <a href="https://libbyapp.com/">Libby</a> or <a href="https://www.audible.com/">Audible</a>. Then I listen to it while making breakfast or home errands.</p>
<p>For articles, I usually start with summary/conclusion. Many times that's where I stop...</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>It's all about skimming.</p>
<p>If you want to read fast: skim the words, read first sentence of every paragraph, or even just headers or book/article.</p>
<p>Faster reading = worse comprehension. The art of speed reading is to find the sweet spot of how much comprehension you are willing to sacrifice for speed of reading.</p>
