<p>Last year, I decided to review most interesting books I read last year, and write down my thoughts. Inspiration comes from <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/">GatesNotes</a>. This post is long overdue, but I'm glad I managed to publish it before the end of 2020 :)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/30lldcB">Deep Learning with Python</a>
<ul>
<li>good overview of different types of ML applications: from basic models than can be mapped to 0 and 1s, through computer vision to text</li>
<li>using Keras and writing python to actually train neural nets while reading this book was super helpful in understanding ML</li>
<li>I think thanks to this book I understood that I do <strong>not</strong> want to build Machine Learning models, but rather apply them in products</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>life principles
<ul>
<li>Decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2 - many time we want to achieve things, but we are not willing to acknowledge reality, I've been guilty of that many times in the past. Realizing that some things are just harder to do than they appear helps tremendously.</li>
<li>open-mindedness and radical transparency are invaluable for rapid learning and effective change</li>
<li>look at yourself with other's eyes - many times (always?) we have totally different image of ourselves than other do</li>
<li>5-Step Process to Get What You Want Out of Life: 1) identify clear goals, 2) identify problems, 3) diagnose problems, 4) create a plan how to deal with problems, 5) execute</li>
<li>remember that all people are wired very differently (they come from different backgrounds, have different experiences and goals)</li>
<li>in his book, Ray Dalio outlines framework for effective decision making: first learn, then decide (be aware of harmful emotions)</li>

<li>instead of chasing fame, try to be useful in what you do today</li>
<li>struggle for what makes you happy</li>
<li>remember that you are probably wrong about majority of things you have opinion about</li>
<li>when making decision, imagine yourself 5-10 years from now and think what would you do if you look back</li>
</ul>
