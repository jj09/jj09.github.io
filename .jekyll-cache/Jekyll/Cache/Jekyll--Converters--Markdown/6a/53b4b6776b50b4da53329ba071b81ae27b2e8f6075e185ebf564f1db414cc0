<p>It has been over 3 years since <a href="https://jj09.net/hi-im-jakub-and-i-work-for-microsoft/">I joined the Azure Portal team</a>. During that time I learned a lot about every aspect of web and mobile development. I delivered <a href="https://jj09.net/speaking/">over 20 technical talks</a> at different conferences around the World and local meetups. It was amazing to take the new Portal from preview to v1. In the meantime, during the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/jobs/one-week-microsoftlife/">//oneweek hackathon</a>, together with a few other folks, we built a prototype of the <a href="https://jj09.net/under-the-hood-of-the-azure-mobile-app/">Azure Mobile App</a>. After getting feedback from Scott Guthrie who said that "it would be super useful" I started working on the app overnight.</p>
<p>I didn't know much about mobile development at the time, but I wanted to learn. I didn't know much about complexities of Active Directory authentication and Azure Resource Manager APIs. I just knew that it would be super cool to have an app that would allow me to check the status of my Azure resources while waiting for my lunch. Receiving a push notification, and being able to scale VM from my phone would be also tremendously valuable.</p>
<p>When I started working on the app full time, my dream came true. I could truly connect my passion with work. I enjoyed the long hours, and late nights we all put to make it happen. The day when Scott Hanselman presented the Azure App at the <a href="https://youtu.be/YKK_XHMFE3U?t=594">//build conference</a> was on of the best days of my life.</p>
<p>Now, when the Azure App is released, and backed by great team, I can move to the next challenge.</p>
<p>Machine learning is becoming part of every aspect of our lives. Over last few years, ML crossed a threshold necessary to be extremely useful. I always wanted to be part of it. I took a great <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Coursera class</a> by Andrew Ng, I started overnight project <a href="https://jj09.net/predicting-future-with-fsharp-and-azure-machine-learning">StockEstimator</a> and I got involved in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/seeing-ai/">SeeingAI</a> to learn how Real-World Machine Learning looks like.</p>
<p>Now, I'm taking it to the next level. I am joining <a href="https://medium.com/@pabloc/a-startup-at-microsoft-43dd2a78b9f5">Azure Search Team</a> to lead their User Experience. I will be responsible for bringing the product to customers. While using my existing web development knowledge, I will have an amazing opportunity to learn more about Big Data, AI and ML.</p>
<p>Azure Search is managed cloud search service that offers scalable full-text search over multiple languages, geo-spatial search, filtering and faceted navigation, type-ahead queries, hit highlighting, and custom analyzers. You can find more details in <a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticon/2015/sf/powering-real-time-search-at-microsoft">this talk</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/pmc">Pablo Castro</a> (Azure Search manager and creator of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data_Protocol">Open Data Protocol</a>).</p>
<p>The cool thing about working for Microsoft is that you may end up working with person who created <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/1.1/rfc2616bis/draft-lafon-rfc2616bis-03.html">HTTP protocol</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Frystyk_Nielsen">Henrik Frystyk Nielsen</a>, former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee's</a> student, who shared office with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kon_Wium_Lie">Håkon Wium Lie</a> (creator of CSS), joined my new team this month. What's even cooler, he is sitting next to me :)</p>
<p>In my new office with Henrik:</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about all the cool stuff we are doing at Cloud AI group there is an awesome .NET Rocks Podcast with Joseph Sirosh. Check it out!</p>

<p>There is also awesome talk by Joseph from the last <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/connectevent/">Connect();</a> conference, which includes <a href="https://github.com/Corom/LibraryOfCorom">JFK files demo</a> presented by Corom Thompson from my team (creator of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/how-the-viral-internet-site-how-oldnet-was-created-and-scaled-with-corom-thompson/">How-Old.NET</a>). In that demo Corom showcases how you can use Azure Search and Cognitive Services to explore JFK files. Super cool! You can see demo in below video, and code on <a href="https://github.com/Corom/LibraryOfCorom">github</a>.</p>

<p>It has never been a better time to work on the intersection of Cloud and Artificial Intelligence!</p>
