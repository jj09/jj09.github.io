I"´<p>After 1 year and 8 months of being a Graduate StudentÂ at Kansas State University and Research AssistantÂ at <a href="http://santoslab.org/">SAnToS Lab</a>Â Research Group I got my Master of Science degree.</p>
<p>Courses I took:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~sdeloach/740/syllabus.html">CIS 740 - Software Engineering</a></li>
<li><a href="http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~sdeloach/544/syllabus.html">CIS 744 - Advanced Software Analysis and Design</a></li>
<li><a href="http://softwarespecs.santoslab.org/">CIS 771 - Software Specification</a></li>
<li><a href="http://compilers.santoslab.org/">CIS 706 - Translator Design</a>Â (my favorite, I <a title="Compilers course I had" href="http://jj09.net/compilers-course-i-had/">blogged</a> about it)</li>
<li><a href="http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~singh/CIS720/F13/cis720.html">CIS 720 - Advanced Operating Systems</a></li>
<li><a href="http://highassurance.santoslab.org/">CIS 890 - High Assurance Systems</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cis.ksu.edu/classes/CourseGoals/721">CIS 721 - Real-Time Operating Systems</a></li>
<li><a href="http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~tamtoft/CIS770/S14/index.html">CIS 770 - Formal Languages Theory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In my first semester as a Graduate Research Assistant at SAnToS Lab I was working on integration <a href="http://www.sireum.org/projects.html">Bakar Kiasan</a>Â withÂ <a href="http://libre.adacore.com/tools/gps/">GNAT Programming Studio</a> (using Python and PyGTK).</p>
<p>In Summer 2013 I started my actual research work, which is captured in my Master Thesis: <a href="http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2097/18222/JakubJedryszek2014.pdf">A Model-Driven Development and Verification Approach for Medical Devices</a>.Â The main problem of my research was to propose translation ofÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_Analysis_%26_Design_Language">AADL</a>/<a href="http://bless.santoslab.org/">BLESS</a>Â models toÂ <a title="SPARK Ada programming language" href="http://jj09.net/spark-ada-programming-language/">SPARK Ada</a>Â programming language. I createdÂ <a href="http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/pca">PCA Pump Prototype</a>Â forÂ <a title="BeagleBoard â€“ your personal computer smaller than your wallet" href="http://jj09.net/beagleboard-your-personal-computer-smaller-than-your-wallet/">BeagleBoard-xM</a>Â platform,Â by translating already existing models (using translations developed by me),Â and performedÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_verification">verification</a>Â (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_code_analysis">static analysis</a>) using <a href="http://docs.adacore.com/sparkdocs-docs/index.html">SPARK Verification Tools</a>.</p>
<p>This is a video from my defense:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/YNypDQ8st04" width="640" height="375" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Unfortunately, QuickTime crashed 3 minutes before the end. Fortunately, you can catch up withÂ <a href="http://jj09.net/pres.ppt">slides</a>.</p>
<p>I created additional video with PCA Pump Prototype demonstration. Pump is developed in SPARK Ada, and it runs on BeagleBoard-xM platform.</p>
<blockquote><p>Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump is a medical device, which allows the patient to self-administer small doses of narcotics (usually Morphine, Dilaudid, Demerol, or Fentanyl). PCA pumps are commonly used after surgery to provide a more effective method of pain control than periodic injections of narcotics. A continuous infusion (called a basal rate) permits the patient to receive a continuous infusion of pain medication. Patient can also request additional boluses, but only in specified intervals. It prevents from overinfusion. In addition to basal and patient bolus, clinician can also request bolus called clinician bolus or square bolus.</p></blockquote>

<p>My Master Thesis in PDF format can be found <a href="http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2097/18222/JakubJedryszek2014.pdf">here</a>. LaTeX source is available <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jj09/masterthesis/src">here</a>.</p>
<p>I spent 2 years at Kansas State University (4 months as anÂ Exchange Student, and 20 months as a Graduate Student). I had very good time and I learnt a lot. I really recommend to get Master degree from a different University than you get your Bachelor. Wroclaw University of Technology (where I got my Bachelor) is more practical. Graduates are ready to work at the industry. Kansas State is more theoretical and research oriented. I had an opportunity to experience both and I am very happy with that!</p>
