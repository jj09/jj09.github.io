I"·<p>Last month I presented how to take advantage of Speech Recognition in the Browser at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/seattlejs/events/224633792/">SeattleJS meetup</a>. Google Chrome is still the only one browser that supports recognizing speech with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API">WebSpeech API</a>, but since last month Microsoft Edge team has <a href="https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6263660-web-speech-api-input">adding WebSpeech API in their backlog</a>. In this session I'm showing how to use the raw, browser API, and also how to easily add voice commands to your website with my <a href="https://github.com/jj09/voiceCmdr">voiceCmdr library</a>.</p>
<p>I also would like to mention that <a href="http://www.meetup.com/seattlejs/">SeattleJS</a> is an awesome meetup with great people. I had many interesting conversationsÂ atÂ the after-party. If you are from the area I really recommend you to check it out!</p>
