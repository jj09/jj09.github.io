I"•<p>Are you using paper notepads to write down ad-hoc notes?</p>
<p>These multi page paper notebooks are super useful. You can just turn the page, save your old sketch and have clean page for new one! WRONG! This is the worst feature! You never look at these notes again, and they just pile up.</p>
<p>Recently, I got <a href="http://amzn.to/2DQCSN2">Boogie Board</a>Â - an LCD writing tablet! It cost $20 and it changed my life.</p>

<p>You can sketch whatever you want, and erase with one button click. It's like a pocket whiteboard. If something is important I just dump it to my OneNote before erasing (rarely happens). You don't have to look for pen anymore. You have one that can be attached to the board, and you can even write with your hands (nails) on it.</p>
<p>I also got <a href="http://amzn.to/2BHZIVe">bigger one</a> for in-office use. My desk before and after:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19511" style="display: inline-block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/assets/2018/02/BoogieBoard-before-e1518064074766.jpg" alt="BoogieBoard - before" width="400" height="533" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19512" style="display: inline-block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/assets/2018/02/BoogieBoard-after-e1518064167901.jpg" alt="BoogieBoard - after" width="400" height="533" /></div>
<p>GetÂ <a href="http://amzn.to/2DQCSN2">one</a>Â or <a href="http://amzn.to/2BHZIVe">big one</a>Â for yourself! It will change your life!</p>
