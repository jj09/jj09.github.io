I" <p>Recently a few people were asking me why I have a blog. Some of them were not programmers. It reminded me about the draft of this post, which I have for more than a year now. I planned to extend it, but I think keeping it short, and maybe edit in the future would be a better solution.</p>
<p>The reasons why I have a blog:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/ghost-who-codes-how-anonymity">The Ghost Who Codes: How Anonymity is Killing Your Programming Career</a></li>
<li>One of <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/educationalpsychology/tp/effective-learning.htm">the best way to learn</a> is to Teach What You've Learned to Another Person (TWYLAP)</li>
<li>Improve my writing skills</li>
<li>To keep my own journal</li>
<li>To be able to google solutions for problems I had (e.g., like <a title="Cannot run JUnit tests, after debugging in ANTLRWorks" href="http://jj09.net/cannot-run-junit-tests-after-debugging-in-antlrworks/">this</a>)</li>
<li>To market myself, show who I am, and what are my interests and beliefs</li>
</ul>
