<p>If you are web developer you have probably heard about some (or all) of these tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.org/">npm (Node Packaged Modules)</a> - package manager for node.js</li>
<li><a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> - package manager for the front-end</li>
<li><a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> - task runner for front-end</li>
<li><a href="http://gulpjs.com/">gulp.js</a> - task runner created under inspiration of grunt (<a title="Gulp â€“ tutorial" href="http://jj09.net/gulp-tutorial/">I blogged about gulp</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> - scaffolder that helps to start new projects by generating (scaffolding) files structure and content based on the best practices</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not have to master all of them, but at least be aware of their functionality, and what they offer.</p>
<p>I will not dig into these tools here, because there areÂ tons of resources online. Good point to start is Scott Allen's talk from NDC 2014: <a href="http://vimeo.com/97501414">Node.JS Tools For Front-End Developers</a>Â (an overview of mentioned tools), and John Papa's article:Â <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/get-up-and-running-with-node-and-visual-studio/">Get Up and Running With Node and Visual Studio</a>Â (demo that take advantage of all tools mentioned above).</p>
