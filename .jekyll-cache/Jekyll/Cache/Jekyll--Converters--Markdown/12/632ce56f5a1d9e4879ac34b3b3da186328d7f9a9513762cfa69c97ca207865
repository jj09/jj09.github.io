<p>Back in 2016, after reading <a href="https://amzn.to/351Rcjn">Peter Thiel's Zero to One</a>, I came up with an idea ofÂ Underground Package Delivery System. At first it would connect just distribution centers. Then we gonna have local dropbox stations. Like Amazon Lockers. Ultimately: everyone will have dropbox in their homes. You order something on amazon, <s>worker</s> machine sends this to you through underground pipes, you get notification, open dropbox which is next to your closet...and it's there! <b>Packages</b> will travel like internet <b>packages</b>.</p>
<p>At first, everyone was laughing and told me that it is IMPOSSIBLE! Only a few months later, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2017/amazon-patent-subterranean-network-delivery/">Amazon was granted a patent for that idea</a>.</p>
<p>I recently discussed this idea with one friend, and decided to re-research it. It looks like a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/underground-tunnels-could-deliver-more-than-600-million-parcels-a-year.html">company from UK (Magway) is working on it</a>! Another company, Mole Solutions, has even built <a href="http://www.molesolutions.co.uk/index.php/demonstrator/">344-foot prototype</a>. They also created awesome video with an overview of the idea:</p>

<p>This is another video of how it would look like:</p>

<p>Magway estimates that it would cost 6 Million Dollars per mile. This is actually not bad! Compare this with urban rail cost per mile being up to 1 Billion Dollars (<a href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/01/why-its-so-expensive-to-build-urban-rail-in-the-us/551408/">source</a>)!</p>
<p>I know that majority of people see the future in drones, but...do you really want to have entire sky polluted with packages?</p>

<p>There is one man, who really believes in tunnels. You know who that is ;) <a href="https://singularityhub.com/2020/02/20/elon-musks-boring-company-finishes-first-tunnel-for-155mph-vegas-loop/">Hint</a>.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
