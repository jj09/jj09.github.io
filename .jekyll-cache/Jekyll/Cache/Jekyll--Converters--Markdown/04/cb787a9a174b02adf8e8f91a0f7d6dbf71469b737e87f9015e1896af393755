<p>I just finished reading <a href="https://rob.conery.io/">Rob Connery</a>'s book <a href="https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook">Imposter's Handbook</a>. It's a very good high-level overview of Computer Science concepts that you may not encounter in everyday job. It is also a good guidance for "what I should know".</p>
<p>If you do not have CS degree I recommend you to check out this book. You can skip chapters about concepts that you are familiar with. If something is new to you - this book will provide you nice introduction to the topic, which you can later on dive in on your own.</p>
<p>If you do have CS degree, I still recommend you to at least check out what's there. I'm sure you will learn something, or at least refresh your knowledge.</p>

<p>Do you have CS degree or you are self-taught programmer?</p>
