I"o<p>If you are running Windows 10 on VirtualBox you may experience limited resolutions availability.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, you can add <em>CustomVideoMode</em> (VirtualBox has to be closed at this time):</p>
<p><code>.\VBoxManage.exe setextradata "VM-Name" CustomVideoMode1 1600x900x32</code></p>
<p>To confirm it is set, use <em>getextradata</em> command:</p>
<p><code>.\VBoxManage.exe getextradata "Win10" CustomVideoMode1</code></p>
<p>Or list all settings:</p>
<p><code>.\VBoxManage.exe getextradata "Win10" enumerate</code></p>

<p>Remember that VirtualBox has to be closed at the time when you execute these commands. If everything went smoothly, you should see new resolution after Virtual Machine restart:</p>

<p>* This might be also an issue withÂ other versions of Windows.</p>
