I"á<p>In 2014,Â Internets wentÂ loud after Erik Meijer's talk <a href="https://vimeo.com/110554082">One Hacker Way</a>. I really liked this talk, because it made me think...actually even until today I didn't figure out everything Erik meant. Unfortunately, most of people didn't understand this talk.</p>

<p>In 2015, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvMuPtuvP5w">gave the same talk again</a>, but the rhetoric was way different. It's more straight forward, and probably more people understood it.</p>

<p>tl;dr This talk is about approach to software engineering, patterns, practices, methodologies, career, and what makes great developer.</p>
