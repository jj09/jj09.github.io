I"¯<p>A few weeks ago,Â when pushing towards the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-azure-portal-general-availability/">new Azure Portal version 1.0 (aka GA at Microsoft)</a>, we added new shortcutsÂ that can be activated with G+[key].</p>
<p>We also changed/updated the old shortcuts that you can find in my previous posts: <a href="http://jj09.net/hidden-feature-of-the-azure-portal-keyboard-shortcuts/">1</a>, <a href="http://jj09.net/more-keyboard-shortcuts-and-better-focus-management-on-the-azure-portal/">2</a>.</p>
<p>The full list of shortcuts is available on pressingÂ <strong>?Â </strong>key:</p>

<p>You may notice that we change shortcut for opening dashboard from H to D. However, H will still work. WeÂ didn't want to take it away from people who already learned it, and got used to that. The same with New (formerly Create): the new shortcut N will work together with C.</p>
<p>BTW: If there is some keyboard, or focus related issue on the portal that is bothering youÂ let me know!</p>
