<p><strong>tl;dr This post is a list of resources for learning F# and overview of my mini-project: Stock Estimator.</strong></p>
<p>I couldn't resist anymore, and I finally tried F#. For the first two days it was painful. Some elements ofÂ F# syntax areÂ weird. However after getting use to that, F# became a joy, and instead of a week (as I planned) I spent with F# almost two months.</p>

<h2>Web Development</h2>
<p>The most popular F# Web Framework is <a href="https://github.com/SuaveIO/suave">Suave</a>. There is great <a href="https://www.gitbook.com/book/theimowski/suave-music-store/details">SuaveMusicStore tutorial</a> (<a href="https://github.com/theimowski/SuaveMusicStore">code</a>), which is inspired by <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/older-versions/mvc-music-store/mvc-music-store-part-1">ASP.NET MVC Music Store tutorial</a>. If you want to build Web API with F#, check <a href="http://blog.tamizhvendan.in/blog/2015/06/11/building-rest-api-in-fsharp-using-suave/">Building REST Api in Fsharp Using Suave</a>.</p>
<p>It is also worth to check <a href="https://vimeo.com/131641270">End-to-end Functional Web Development</a> by <a href="http://tomasp.net/">Tomas Petricek</a> where he showcases building web app with Suave.</p>

<h2>Stock Estimator</h2>
<p>I created F# based app for predicting future stock prices ($1,000,000Â idea!). The back-end is written in F#, and communicates with stock data API (Yahoo Finance) through F# type provider. There is also Suave Web API (microservice), and ASP.NET Core web app that communicates with it. Front-end is powered by <a href="http://aurelia.io/">Aurelia Framework</a>, and <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3 library</a>. In other words:Â IÂ built F# microservice, consumedÂ it from non-F#Â app, and have reusable logic in separated project.Â All communication with microserviceÂ happens through the client (with Aurelia Framework). So, there is no usage of F# from C#, but...I also created simple Console app (with C#) that uses mentioned F# logic. There is also Windows Forms app for displaying estimates, written in F#, that also useÂ reusable logic.</p>
<p>Entire source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/jj09/StockEstimator">github</a>. Check it out!</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Programming in F# is pure joy! It's a great language forÂ working with data.Â Moreover, F# fits perfectly into today's World of microservices. You don't have to rewrite your already existing app, or create entire app with F#. You can just create oneÂ microserviceÂ with F#, and see how itÂ works for you!</p>
