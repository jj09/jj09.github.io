<p>Most of you probably do not know about my joruney to Microsoft. I know that every person in this company has their own story. I decided to share mine.</p>
<p>Today, living in USA and working for Microsoft is just a routine. 7 years ago it was a faraway dream.</p>
<p>I grew up in small town near German and Czech border: Jelenia Gora.</p>

<p>It started in 2011 when I decided I should move to USA. After months of hussling I managed to get into an exchange program with Kansas State University where I got scolarship that covered my tuition, housing, and dining costs. At that time I didn't have money to pay for it out of my pocket. I came to USA with $1000 in my pocket, from which I spent over $600 on health insurance and TB testing. I knew I had to find a job. I was very lucky because one student who graduated just leff his job at Division of Communication and Marketing, and they had an opening. I was able to land an interview, and got a job. I was making $9/h. I was living the American Dream.</p>

<p>My English wasn't great, and sometimes I had hard time to understand people talking at work. It was even worse during the classes. Because of my friend's recommendation (who just finished his PhD at the time), I decided to take the "interesting" (AKA the hardest) classes. Topics that would be hard to understand even in my native language (Polish), now I had to understand in English. The struggle was real. While working 20h/week, taking 12 Graduate credits and working on my Bachelor Thesis (yes, in Poland we had to write a thesis to get Bachelor degree) I was able to go through the semester with GPA 3.5.</p>
