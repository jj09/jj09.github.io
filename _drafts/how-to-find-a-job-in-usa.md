<p>From time to time friends, or some people who reach out to me are asking for an advice about how to find a job in USA.</p>
<p>This process is different for permanent residents (US Citizens or Green Card holders) and 'foreigners'. It seems like it shouldn't be an issue if you are good, qualified candidate...but it is.</p>
<h3>Why is it harder to find a job when you are not permanent resident?</h3>
<p>There is only one option you can work in US as non-resident. You need a Visa (I am not talking about credit card!). I don't want to go into details, because it is really complicated and different for almost every one depends on their particular situation. More about US Visas can be found on Alex's McCaw blog: <a href="http://blog.sourcing.io/visa-guide">Engineer’s Guide to US Visas</a>.</p>
<p>Because of that, many companies (especially small ones) do not hire people, who don't have permanent residency. The reason is simple: they have much less problems with hiring local candidate, who can start work even next day. For Working Visa, you need to wait even a year or longer! Additionally you need lawyers who will handle that.</p>
<h3>How US Universities are helping their students to find a job</h3>
<p>I was a student at Kansas State University and I don't know, how it looks like on other Universities. However, I guess it might be very similar.</p>
<p>When I was studying in Poland we had Career Fairs during the semester. It is the same in USA. The difference is: here, at Kansas State, the Career and Employment Services have bunch of resources and advice how to prepare for it. They tell you <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/ces/students/dresstoimpress.html">how to dress</a>, <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/ces/students/informationalinterviewingguide.html">how to behave during the interview</a> or even <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/ces/students/documents/HowToWorkCareerFair-ENGGCF.pdf">during conversation at Career Fair</a>. In my last semester, there was even <a href="http://www.k-state.edu/ces/students/documents/workshopdiningetiquettebrochure.pdf">'Dinner Etiquette workshops'</a>! Unfortunately I didn't have time to attend. I am really impressed by the amount of <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/ces/students/index.html">resources</a> they have.</p>
<p>A few times during the semester, there is an event called: Mock Interviews. Companies send their recruiters to perform a interview with students. The advantage is that everybody who want to get an interview is getting it, and there is no obligations. You can follow-up with company/interviewer if you want to. It is a great opportunity to practice before the real interview and get the feedback from 'real interviewer'. I attended to one, it was like a real interview.</p>
<p>At my University, I could create <a href="https://www.k-state.edu/ces/students/cesaccount.html">online account</a>, which allows me e.g. upload my resume and make it available for the companies. I can also come over to their office and ask about some more advises.</p>
<p>There is also an office for International Students, who provide sessions about Visas processes and how to obtain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optional_Practical_Training">OPT</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa">H1-B visa</a>.</p>
<h3>Applying for a job</h3>
<p>I applied to two small companies. One said, they do not sponsor (hire) non-residents. Second one didn't even reply. I have also applied to a few big companies. The process of getting a job is really long. It took me 3 months from applying to getting the offer (from Microsoft, which I accepted). One company rejected me within 1 week and two others replied for my application after 3 months(!) with an interview offer (which I rejected, because I already had a job offer from Microsoft). Some companies are recruiting on campus. They even do on-campus interviews, which is pre-selection of candidates. Usually, recruitment for Spring semester graduates starts in Fall. An advice here is: start looking for a job at least a year before your graduation.</p>
<h3>Preparing for interview</h3>
<p>In order to prepare for coding interview I recommend to learn algorithms and practice as much as you can. Check my <a href="http://jj09.net/how-to-become-a-better-programmer-developer/">How to become a better programmer</a> blog post. If you have any other questions, let me know and I would be happy to update this blog post.</p>
