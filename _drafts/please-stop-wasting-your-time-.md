<p>There is one thing I hate with a passion. Wasting time. I don't mean watching TV, or hanging out at the bar with friends. I mean doing things that does not matter, and will not make any difference.</p>
<p>If you are a software developer, and you are working on something that already has been done, e.g., implementing some algorithm that is available in open source library or, what's even worse, in your programming language library. As long as you are not doing it to learn that algorithm to maybe improve your coding skills, you are just wasting your time.</p>
<p>When you are coming back from the store, and you realize "Damn, I forgot eggs". Now, you need to go back or you won't be able to make a breakfast tomorrow. Here is 30 minutes of time wasted. This was happening to me so often. To solve this problem I created <a href="http://github.com/jj09/ShoppingPad">Shopping Pad</a> - a mobile app that helps you create your shopping list fast and has simple interface that minimize number of clicks to get things done. It keeps track on items you bought in the past, and how often. Thanks to that, next time you are going shopping you can use your 'past purchases' list to create new shopping list for the store run. Do you have similar experiences with forgetting stuff?</p>
<p>I know that you may think: not everyone is able to change the World. WRONG! Everybody is, but to different extent. What's more: small changes everyday add up, and became huge impact over time. As I wrote in one of blog posts <a href="http://jj09.net/how-we-saved-1000000-for-microsoft-with-this-one-small-change/">How we saved $1,000,000 for Microsoft with this one, small change</a>. Another important thing is to realize that every person has different skills. Every person has something that can make a difference. Peter Norvig summarized it well in his article <a href="http://norvig.com/performance-review.html">'05 Annual Performance Review: Albert Einstein</a>.</p>
<p>I love Uber! I love it because they make getting from place to place much more efficient. You don't need to call for taxi, you don't need people who will take your call, and you will know almost exactly when your ride will arrive thanks to the app. If you add up amount of time people save thanks to Uber you will probably get millions of hours. Yes, MILLIONS. Imagine, what could YOU do with all that time. What could WE do with all that time. We could focus on things that matter: fighting poverty, helping to improve access to education or working on clean, renewable energy.</p>
<p>The amount of impact we can contribute depends if we are doing things where we can make the most difference.</p>
<p>Actually, watching TV or spending time with Friends is not a waste. We need time to rest, and take care of our relationships. Also: this put our <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-brain-work/201209/stop-trying-solve-problems">unconscious mind to work</a>.</p>
<p>There is one thing I didn't figure out yet how to improve: keeping track of what I have done. To use it for retrospection, analyze, and make improvements for the future. I keep track of everything I do for work everyday, and I go through it at the end of the week, end of the month, end of the quarter, mid-year, and the end of the year. This helps me to spot where I wasted time, whether I am doing right things, and whether I should make any adjustments to future plans.</p>
<p>How are you making sure you don't waste your time?</p>
