<p>As part of Facebook Marketplace Growth Team I learned about the concept of Growth Teams.</p>
<p>At Facebook you can set your own title. Most of people have generic titles, like Software Engineer, Front End Engineer, Product Manager, Designer, Engineering Manager, etc. I made mine 'Growth Hacker' for the time being.</p>
<ul>
<li>novelty effect</li>
<li>2 weeks to run experiment</li>
<li>something that worked in the past may not work now, and opposite</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
