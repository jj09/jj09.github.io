The Ironman triathlon is 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike and 26.2 mile run (marathon). You have 17 hours to complete it in order to finish.

<h2>How I got into triathlons</h2>

I've been doing triathlons for over 5 years now. Mostly Sprint and Olympic distances. Ocassionally half Ironman (AKA Ironman 70.3). The Sprint distance is 750m of swimming, followed by 20km bike and 5k run. Olympic is double of that: 1.5k swim + 40k bike + 10k run. Half Ironman is 1.2 mile swim + 56 mile bike + 13.1 mile run (half marathon), which adds up to total of 70.3 miles. Hence, it's also being called Ironman 70.3.

I love biking since I was a kid. When I got to college, inspired by Lance Armstrong, I decided to try triathlons. Unfortunately, it took me a while as I was going through knee injury at the time, which ended up with arthroscopy. Coming back to sports after that took over 1 year.

The first triathlon, I've ever done was indoor triathlon i55: 10 mins of swimming, 30 mins of biking and 15 mins of running. The final result was based on the distance covered. As most of beginners, I pushed too hard on bike, and was barely able to run for 15 minutes. Despite that, I was hooked, and soon after that signed up for my very first sprint triathlon.

The sprint triathlon didn't happen, because of the water quality at Juanita Beach in Kirkland. A few days before the race, they changed triathlon to run-bike-run, which was ultimately a duathlon. I still got triathlon finisher medal as they had them made before finding out about the water quality issue.

Despite all the obstacles, I decided to keep going, and signed up for an Olympic Triathlon. It was Troika Triathlon in Spokane, WA. It was almost my first, legit triathlon. Almost because of weather issues they cut the swim short, and added distance to bike :O I still liked the challenge, and decided to take it to the next level. I did one more Olympic tri and entered the serious triathlon World by doing half-Ironman distance race. It was actually much easier than I thought, and I was thinking that maybe I would've been able to pull a full distance that day!

While training for half-Ironman though, I learned that you cannot live life like you use to and just throw trainings in the spare time. You need to add time for rest, and take care of the nutrition. One week before the half-Ironman race I was soo tired that I spent entire weekend in bed. I wasn't sick. No cold, or sore throat. I was just exhausted.

Over years I did a few more Sprint, Olympic and one more Ironman 70.3 triathlon. While olympic distance races went well, the half-Ironman was a challenge. I was dealing with foot injury, and decided to just run less during the training for the race. This, didn't ended up well. After the race, I messed up my foot so bad that I was barely able to walk. Fortunately, after a week or so I was fine. At that time I didn't even stretch before and after workouts!

I consluded that races above Olympic distance are not healthy. They require more time to train that you need to stay healthy. There is too much strain on your body. Often ending up in injuries. There is also need to spend more time that I would want training than doing other things. Wanna go hiking this weekend? No, I need to do planned swim. If I won't my training plan will get screw up, and I'll have to readjust it...and I won't be prepared to the race as good as I should've.

<h2>Ironman journey</h2>

I knew that at some point in my life I wanted to finish the full distance Ironman triathlon. I was delaying it as I knew that it will require significant time cmmitment not only for time to train, but also for time to rest. Then COViD happen, and it put a pause to my favorite sport. In 2020, when all events were cancelled, I did Sprint and Olympic triathlon with friends. We just swam, changed to bike outfit, did the bike distance, and after locking bikes securely in our cars, finished everything with a run.

When, in 2021 triathlons started happening again, I decided to do Ironman 70.3 Oregon. I was hungry. As running was my weakest discipline, because of knee injuries, I decided to do half Marathon earlier that year. My thinking was: if I finish half marathon, I can do half Ironman. Swimming and biking wasn't a problem for me. The running was the issue. I followed adjusted 6 weeks to race training plan, and that was enough to finish. After finishing in July 2021, I thought: why not keep training and do a full Ironman this year? There was Ironman California, just 3 months away, which would give me enough time to build up from half to full Ironman. After discussing it with my wife, I signed up!

<h3>Training</h3>

I followed [My First Ironman Training Plan](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/kpdocshare/Training_Plans/TRI38.First_Ironman.pdf). I made 1 adjustments: I was doing only 1 swim per week instead of 2. Reason? Swimming takes a lot of time. Driving to the pool (or lake), changing, driving back, etc. It's much more time consuming than biking and running. The Ironman California is down river swim, which makes it much easier. Thus, I decided to undertrain for swimming and prioritize biking and running.

Half way through my training I decided to do a quick consult with a coach. This made me to realize how much I didn't know, and how much more I could've learn. I recommend anyone who want to attempt an Ironman to get a coach FROM THE BEGINNING!!! It will make your training more efficient, more enjoyable and less stressful. Is that enough? Am I doing it right? Isn't that too much if I just want to finish? Coach, who already done Ironman, and trained others can help to answer that questions.

I maintained a Google Spreadsheet where I tracked all my workouts. I used green for workouts I did as planned (at least 80% or more of planned distance). Yellow for workouts that were cut short (below 80%), and red for workouts I skipped workouts. Marking workouts as done (green) was one of the best parts of my day.

<h3>Life</h3>

Training for Ironman is not only about making time for training, but also about making more time for resting! I underestimated how much more time I would need for rest. Especially, during the weekends after long workouts. I just wanted to lay down in bed and watch TV...

Sometimes, easy thing like attending baby shower at 2PM on Saturday or joining friends to watch new James Bond movie in the cinema that my friend rented was impossible. I couldn't do baby shower because that day I had to ride 100 miles. For me that was ~8h...I would have to start at ~5AM, and to have 1h for shower/stretch and driving to baby shower. Not ideal. Especially taking into account that sunrise at the time was after 7AM. When planning to watch the new Bond movie with friends at 1PM, I had only 90mins run planned for that day. However, I had to change that plan (when everything was already set for the movie), and I had to run 16 miles, which took me almost 4 hours. I planned to start at 8AM, but my body said no to 6AM wake up. I ended up starting after 9AM, and finished around 1PM. I skipped the movie. The Ironman dream was more important.

When reading this you probably think: couldn't you just move that workout to different day or do it after the movie? Well, it's not that easy. Doing it after the movie would require me to start around 5PM at best. Finishing long run at 9PM is not great. Moving to another day? It's not easy to ensure that you do enough of swimming, biking and running even when everything goes according to the plan. Trying to move things around, especially closer to race, is hard. Of course you can do it, but...you would be prepared worse.The weather is another component that comes to play. The rain and cold may mess up your plans for good.

Regarding the weather I was actually pretty fortunate, taking into account I live in Seattle, and weather here in September/October can be not the best. I had to shuffle workouts a bit, do some zwift biking instead of running outside, and replace Open Water Swims with pool. The most important long runs and long bike rides I was able to do outdoor! Yay!

<h3>Challenges</h3>

On top of already mentioned time-management issues and weather, you may also run into another very common obstacle: injury. This happened to me ~4-5 weeks before the race. My knee didn't handle training load well. I also messed up by forgetting a knee brace that I usually wear for one of my long runs.

Many people quit at that point. I decided to do whatever it takes. Countless PT sessions, stretching, messages and hours of exercises at home on top of my workouts helped to alleviate the issue. I was still not very confident that I will be able to finish the race though.

I did whatever I could, overcame all the obstacles: time management, sacrificing social life, and managing injury. Unfortunately, I couldn't overcome the final obstacle. The race was cancelled because of [Bomb Cyclone](https://www.tri247.com/triathlon-news/elite/ironman-california-cancelled-weather)! They announced it at the race morning when I was putting my wetsuit on. To be honest: that was the only reasonable decision. The day after, there were fallen trees on the bike course, and run course was flooded.

I was devastated. All the sacrifices and hard work for nothing. I tried to look at the bright side though. I decided to properly recover from injuries, and attempt it again next year!

<h3>Recovery</h3>

When Ironman got cancelled I jumped straight into PT. Dan Benson from ForeFront PT is the best specialist I've ever worked with. He not only helped me to recover, but also gave me some tips that helped to improve my running. It took over 4 months since I started till I could finally run like a normal person. Performing set of exercises that would take 30 mins or so every other day was thing I hated. There is nothing fun about PT exercises like hip rotations, penguin walks with band, side squats or speed skitters. I was happy I was able to go back to running, strengthen my hip muscles, and actually start running properly. Per Dan's advice I tried to keep 175 steps per minute cadence, which is not easy! Everytime when I was hurting, increasing cadence seemed to fix it. That was a silver bullet.

<h3>Smarter Training</h3>

Thanks to all experience from the previous year, I knew better how to manage my time during the training. No social life for 3 months, with 1 exception for a housewarming party. No international travel during that time either. I really spend 3 months focused on the race. My life was: work, training, rest. Not much room for anything else. I sometimes work 50-60h weeks, and it was hard not only for my but also on my wife. We were commited though, as we both knew it would be just one and done. Maybe I'll do Kona after I retire ;) I prepared better in all disciplines. I followed the same [My First Ironman Training Plan](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/kpdocshare/Training_Plans/TRI38.First_Ironman.pdf). I still swam only once per week. This time I modified long runs to be distance based building up to 16 miles as longest run per my coach recommendation.

I vastly improved nutrition, both during and after training. I showed up on the start line stronger than year before and injury free.


<h3>Successful race</h3>

My pacing plan:

* swim: treat it as a warm up, swim at good pace, but don't push
* bike: 80-90 rpm, HR below 144 bpm
* run: walk first 10 minutes, then run 0.3 mile / walk 0.1 mile, walk through every aid station

My nutrition plan:

* bike: in hours 1,3,5, and 6/7 hours - drink tailwind+gatorade mix (40-80g carbs per hours), in hours 2,4,6 - eat 1x honey stinger, 1x gel, 1x cliff block
* run: 1 gel every 15 mins, tailwind+gatorade on the half way point (special needs bag)

<h2>Reflection</h2>

Nutrition:

All good, but after half way through the run switch to chips+pretzels+coke, and get chicken broth whenever available!!!

Thoughts:

* stretching is extremely important
* PT exercises once a week are great. Ideally connected with strength training

In July I did 22h of training. It's recommended that all of us do 30mins/day -> 15h/month. I just did extra 7h on top of that!
If you want to do sprint triathlon you can do it with 3.5h/week or less! 2x30 mins run + 1x30 mins swim + 1x1-2h bike ride!
