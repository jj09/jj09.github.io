<p>Since joining Facebook, this blog is not very technical. This is mostly caused by extreme scrutiny that company is facing. I wish I could've share more about awesome things we did at Facebook Marketplace to help over 1 Billion people to buy and sell used things for cheap instead of throwing them away and buying new, expensive items. It's just a safety measure to prevent others from taking 1 single data point, putting it our of context and building a Sci-Fi narrative. Instead I blog about my <a href="https://jj09.net/puppy-tutorial/"><s>puppy</s> dog</a>, and now Ironman triathlon.</p>
<h3>How did I get into triathlon</h3>
- Lance
- Biking
- Didn't want to be fat: these guys who can do STP, but are 20lbs+ overweight.

<p>The Ironman triathlon is 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike and 26.2 mile run (marathon). You have 17 hours to complete in order to finish.</p>

<h3>Training</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>I found <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/kpdocshare/Training_Plans/TRI38.First_Ironman.pdf">a plan</a> online, which I started to follow. I did a quick consult with a coach (Lesley Mettler)...only to realize how much I don't know, and how much more I could've learn. I recommend anyone who want to attempt Ironman to get a coach FROM THE BEGINNING!!! It will make your training more efficient, more enjoyable and less stressful (is that enough? am I doing it right?).</p>

<p>I maintained a Google Spreadsheet where I tracked all my workouts. I used green for workouts I did as planned (at least 80%+ of planned distance). Yellow were workouts cut short (below 80%, but I did something), and red were skipped workouts). The best part of my day was when after training I was going to the spreadsheet and I was marking workout as done (green).</p>

<p>Life</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Training for Ironman is not only about making time for training, but also about making more time for resting! I underestimated how much more time I would need for rest. Especially, during the weekends after long workouts I just wanted to lay down in bed and watch TV...</p>

<p>Sometimes, easy thing like attending baby shower at 2PM on Saturday or joining friends for new James Bond movie that my friend rented cinema for is impossible. I couldn't do baby shower because that day I had to ride 100 miles. For me that was ~8h...I would have to start at ~5AM, and to have 1h for shower/stretch and driving to baby shower...not ideal taking into account that sunrise at the time was after 7AM. When planning to watch the new Bond movie with friends at 1PM, I had only 90mins run planned for that day...but plan changed a week before (when everything was set for the movie), and I had to run 16 miles, which took me almost 4 hours. I planned to start at 8AM, but my body said no to 6AM wake up...and I ended up starting after 9AM, and finished around 1PM...no time to shower/stretch/drive to the cinema...and I skipped the movie.</p>

<p>When reading this you probably think: couldn't you just move that workout to different day or wake up earlier? On top of your body that is tired, your workout plan which is pretty packed (you cannot easily move workouts without impact on your training and you want to prepare the best you can right?), the weather is another component that comes to play. I am talking only about sunrise time, but also about rain and cold.</p>

<p>Regarding the weather I was actually pretty fortunate taking into account I live in Seattle, and weather here in September/October can be not the best. I had to shuffle workouts a bit, do some zwift biking instead of running outside, and replace Open Water Swims with pool...but the most important long runs and long bike rides I was able to do outdoor! Thank you!</p>

<p>Challenges</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On top of already mentioned time-management issues and weather, you may also run into another obstacle: injury. This happened to me ~4-5 weeks before the race. My knee didn't handle training load well, and I also messed up by forgetting a knee brace for my long run.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Situations like that are easy to make you quit. Alternative, which I took, is countless PT sessions, stretching, messages and exercises at home on top of my workouts.</p>

<li>stretching is extremely important</li>

<h3>Why do I care?</h3>
In July I did 22h of training. It's recommended that all of us do 30mins/day -> 15h/month. I just did extra 7h on top of that!
If you want to do sprint triathlon you can do it with 3.5h/week or less! 2x30 mins run + 1x30 mins swim + 1x1-2h bike ride!
