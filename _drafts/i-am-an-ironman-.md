The Ironman triathlon is 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike and 26.2 mile run (marathon). You have 17 hours to complete it in order to finish.

<h2>How I got into triathlons</h2>

I've been doing triathlons for over 5 years now. Mostly Sprint and Olympic distances. Ocassionally half Ironman (AKA Ironman 70.3). 

This is what each distance contains:
- Sprint: 750m swim + 20km bike + 5k run
- Olympic: 1.5k swim + 40k bike + 10k run
- Half Ironman: 1.2 mile swim + 56 mile bike + 13.1 mile run (half marathon) - the total distance is 70.3 miles, therefore it's also called Ironman 70.3.

I love biking since I was a kid. I decided to try triathlons when I was in college. Unfortunately, it took me a while to finish my first triathlon, because I was going through knee injury. It ended up with arthroscopy. Coming back to sports after that took over 1 year.

The first triathlon, I've ever done was indoor triathlon i55: 10 mins of swimming + 30 mins of biking + 15 mins of running. The final result was based on the total distance covered. As most beginners, I pushed too hard on bike, and was barely able to run for 15 minutes. Despite that, I was hooked, and soon after that signed up for my very first sprint triathlon.

The first sprint triathlon I signed up for (Kirkland Triathlon) didn't happen, because of the water quality at Juanita Beach in Kirkland. A few days before the race, they changed triathlon to run-bike-run, which was ultimately a duathlon. I still got triathlon finisher medal as they had them made before finding out about the water quality issue.

Despite all the obstacles, I decided to keep going. I kinda did sprint, so I went ahead and signed up for an Olympic Triathlon. It was Troika Triathlon in Spokane, WA. It was almost my first, legit triathlon. Almost, because the swim was cut short due to the weather issues, and bike distance was extended to compensate for shorter swim. I really enjoyed the challenge, and decided to take it to the next level. I did one more Olympic tri and entered the serious triathlon World by doing half-Ironman distance race. It was actually much easier than I thought, and I was thinking that maybe I would've been able to pull a full distance that day!

While training for half-Ironman though, I learned that you cannot live life like you use to and just throw trainings in the spare time. You need to add time for rest, and take care of the nutrition. One week before the half-Ironman I was soo tired that I spent entire weekend in bed. I wasn't sick. No cold, or sore throat. I was just exhausted.

Over years I did a few more sprints, olympics and one more Ironman 70.3 triathlon. While olympic distance races went well, the half-Ironman was a challenge. I was dealing with foot injury, and decided to just run less during the training for the race. This, didn't ended up well. After the race, I messed up my foot so bad that I was barely able to walk. Fortunately, after a week or so I was fine. At that time I didn't even stretch before and after workouts! Still had a lot to learn.

After the Ironman 70.3, which ended up with injury I concluded that races above Olympic distance are not healthy. They require more time to train that you need to stay healthy. There is too much strain on your body. Often ending up in injuries. There is also need to spend more time that I would like to in training. You want to go hiking this weekend? No, I need to do my planned swim. If I won't my training plan will get screw up, and I'll have to readjust it...and I won't be prepared for the race as good as if I've done the planned session.

<h2>Ironman journey</h2>

I knew that at some point in my life I wanted to finish the full distance Ironman triathlon. I was delaying it, because I knew that it would require significant time cmmitment. Not only for time to train, but also for time to rest. When COViD happen, and it put a pause to my favorite sport I realized (again) that life is short, and I shouldn't postpone things. In 2020, when all races were cancelled, I did Sprint and Olympic triathlon with friends. We just swam, biked and run on our own. It was fun, but not as fun as real races.

When, in 2021 triathlons started happening again, I decided to do Ironman 70.3 Oregon. I was hungry. As running was my weakest discipline, because of the knee injuries, I decided to do half Marathon earlier that year. My thinking was: if I finish half marathon, I can do half Ironman. Swimming and biking wasn't a problem for me. I did half marathon, followed by Olympic triathlon, and finished half Ironman. Injury free! When I was done, I thought: why not keep training and do a full Ironman this year? There was Ironman California, just 3 months away. This would give me enough time to build up from half to full Ironman. After discussing it with my wife, I signed up!

<h3>Training</h3>

I followed [My First Ironman Training Plan](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/kpdocshare/Training_Plans/TRI38.First_Ironman.pdf). I made one adjustment: I was doing only 1 swim per week instead of 2. Reason? Swimming takes a lot of time. Driving to the pool (or lake), changing, driving back, etc. It's much more time consuming than biking and running. The Ironman California is down river swim, which makes it much easier. Thus, I decided to undertrain for swimming and prioritize biking and running.

Half way through my training I decided to do a quick consult with a coach. This made me to realize how much I didn't know, and how much more I could've learn. I recommend anyone who want to attempt an Ironman to get a coach FROM THE BEGINNING!!! It will make your training more efficient, more enjoyable and less stressful. Is that enough? Am I doing it right? Isn't that too much if I just want to finish? Coach, who already done Ironman, and trained others, can help to answer that questions. Thanks to my coach I realized that I won't be able to run the marathon during Ironman. The same like the other 80% of athleets. Only pros and top age-groupers run entire marathon. Most of people run/walk or just walk. Thanks to that I developed run/walk strategy that made my running more efficient: 0.3mi run / 0.1mi walk.

I maintained a Google Spreadsheet where I tracked all my workouts. I used green for workouts I did as planned (at least 80% or more of planned distance), yellow for workouts that were cut short (below 80%), and red for workouts I skipped. Marking workouts as done (green) was one of the best parts of my day.

<h3>Life</h3>

Training for Ironman is not only about making time for training, but also about making more time for resting! I underestimated how much more time I would need for rest. Especially, during the weekends after long workouts. I just wanted to lay down in bed and watch TV...

Sometimes, easy thing like attending baby shower at 2PM on Saturday or joining friends to watch new James Bond movie in the cinema that my friend rented was impossible. I couldn't do baby shower because that day I had to ride 100 miles. For me that was ~8h...I would have to start at ~5AM, and to have 1h for shower/stretch and driving to baby shower. Not ideal. Especially taking into account that sunrise at the time was after 7AM. When planning to watch the new Bond movie with friends at 1PM, I had only 90mins run planned for that day. However, I had to change that plan (when everything was already set for the movie), and I had to run 16 miles instead, which took me almost 4 hours. I planned to start at 8AM, but my body said no to 6AM wake up. I ended up starting after 9AM, and finished around 1PM. I skipped the movie. The Ironman dream was more important.

When reading this you probably think: couldn't you just move that workout to different day or do it after the movie? Well, it's not that easy. Doing it after the movie would require me to start around 5PM at best. Finishing long run at 9PM is not great. Moving to another day? It's not easy to ensure that you do enough of swimming, biking and running even when everything goes according to the plan. Trying to move things around, especially closer to race, is hard. Of course you can do it, but...you would be less prepared. You don't want to DNF (Did Not Finish), because you decided to attend this one baby shower. 

The weather is another component that comes to play. The rain and cold may mess up your plans for good. I was actually pretty fortunate, taking into account I live in Seattle, and weather here in September/October (peak training months) can be not the best. I had to shuffle workouts a bit, do some zwift biking instead of running outside, and replace Open Water Swims with pool. The most important long runs and long bike rides I was able to do outdoor! Yay! I've seen other athleetes who had to subside long 4h+ rides with trainer...I would've hate that.

<h3>Challenges</h3>

On top of already mentioned time-management issues and weather, you may also run into another very common obstacle: injuries. This happened to me ~4-5 weeks before the race. My knee didn't handle training load well. I also messed up by forgetting a knee brace that I usually wear for one of my long runs.

Many people quit at that point. I decided to do whatever it takes. I wanted to become Ironman and be done. Countless PT sessions, stretching, messages and hours of exercises at home on top of my workouts helped to alleviate the issue. I was still not very confident that I will be able to finish the race.

I did whatever I could, overcame all the obstacles: time management, sacrificing social life, and managing injury. Unfortunately, I couldn't overcome the final obstacle. The race was cancelled because of [Bomb Cyclone](https://www.tri247.com/triathlon-news/elite/ironman-california-cancelled-weather)! They announced it at the race morning when I was putting my wetsuit on. To be honest: that was the only reasonable decision. It was rainy and winds were crazy. Up to 30-40 mph. The day after, there were fallen trees on the bike course, and run course was flooded.

I was devastated. All the sacrifices and hard work for nothing. I tried to look at the bright side though. I decided to properly recover from injuries, and attempt it again next year!

<h3>Recovery</h3>

When Ironman got cancelled I jumped straight into PT. Dan Benson from ForeFront PT is the best specialist I've ever worked with. He not only helped me to recover, but also gave me some tips that helped to improve my running. It took over 4 months since I started till I could finally run like I used to. Performing set of exercises that would take 30 mins or so every other day was a thing I hated. But I was doing it having the grand goal in mind. There is nothing fun about PT exercises like hip rotations, penguin walks with band, side squats or speed skitters. I was happy I was able to go back to running, strengthen my hip muscles, and actually start running properly. Per Dan's advice I tried to keep 175 steps per minute cadence, which is not easy! Everytime when I was hurting, increasing cadence seemed to fix it. That was a silver bullet. After 4 months I could run, and I did 5k race that went smooth.

<h3>Smarter Training</h3>

Thanks to the experience from the previous year, I knew better how to manage my time during the training. No social life for 3 months, with 1 exception for a housewarming party. No international travel during that time either. I really spent 3 months focused on the race. My life was: work, training, rest. Not much room for anything else. I sometimes work 50-60h weeks, and it was hard not only for my but also for my wife. We were both commited though, as we both knew it would be just one and done. I am very grateful for her support. Without that becoming Ironman wouldn't be possible. I prepared better in all disciplines. I followed the same [My First Ironman Training Plan](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/kpdocshare/Training_Plans/TRI38.First_Ironman.pdf). I still swam only once per week. This time I modified long runs to be distance based building up to 16 miles as longest run per my coach recommendation.

I vastly improved nutrition, both during and after training. I showed up on the start line stronger than year before and injury free.

<h3>Successful race</h3>

My pacing plan:

* swim: treat it as a warm up, swim at good pace, but don't push
* bike: 80-90 rpm, HR below 144 bpm
* run: walk first 10 minutes, then run 0.3 mile / walk 0.1 mile, walk through every aid station

My nutrition plan:

* bike: in hours 1,3,5, and 6/7 hours - drink tailwind+gatorade mix (40-80g carbs per hours), in hours 2,4,6 - eat 1x honey stinger, 1x gel, 1x cliff block
* run: 1 gel every 15 mins, tailwind+gatorade on the half way point (special needs bag)

There were some challenges during the race. Before getting to water I walked 5000 steps and spent 1 hour in line to the shuttle taking athleetes from the transition zone to swim start. [Lose yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Yhyp-_hX2s) at the swim start when I was entering the water gave me good kick, and swim went great. It was very enjoyable experience. After it, however, I had to **run barefoot on concrete for 1 mile** from swim exit to transition. I was very worried that I would get injuried during that, and the race will be over. I took it very easy, walking parts of it, and made to bike. 

The bike part (112 miles) was not easy. I experienced the strongest winds I've ever had while biking. Winds were 20-30mph! That was stronger than winds in Kona were I rode 1 year earlier. Bike course had two out and back loops (56 miles each). Some parts of the course were getting tail wind, but other parts had head wind, and the worst possible: cross winds. I had to be focused every single second to don't crash. It was very energy and mentaly draining. A few athleetes ended there race by crashing on the bike due to the wind. The last few miles were especially tough, because it was against the wind, and wind picked up later in the day. It was windy till the very last turn into transition. 

When I got off the bike it was hard to walk. I was asking myself: "How am I gonna run a marathon now?". I thought it was impossible, but I was trying not to think too much about it. Instead, I was just executing my race plan. I took my time during the transition, changed to running gear, and walked for the first 10 minutes like I planned. After that, I started my run/walk strategy 0.3mi run / 0.1mi walk. I was also walking through aid stations, sometimes stopping for bathroom breaks. First 9 miles went pretty well. After that, I experienced what Ironman athleetes call the dark moment. It was literally dark as we entered the park without much lights. Thankfully to Ironman race organizers they were giving away head lamps. Even with the head lamp, it was dark... The miles were going slowly and I was getting weaker. I had my rocket fuel mix (tailwind+gatorade) in run special needs bag, which was at mile 10.5. I drank almost entire bottle, and I felt like I want to puke for next 30-45 mins. I knew however, that I would be better off not feeling great than bonking. Sometimes I was wondering where is the next mile marker. A few times I thought that maybe I missed it, and the next one would be the following mile. Only to find a few minutes later that I just got to the one that I thought I passed... The park section was out and back. After making the u-turn at mile 14.5 I started thinking that maybe there is a way to finish. It was more and more painful though. I started calculating how fast I need to run/walk, and it looked good. I even decided to walk 1 mile to see how much faster I am run walking. It wasn't much. Less than 5 minutes! However, at that point it was more painful to walk than run! When I got to mile 20, one volounteer said that it's only 10k to finish. 6.2 miles is 10k! This gave me power. From that point aI threw out my strategy and just went.

<h2>Reflection</h2>

Nutrition:

All good, but after half way through the run switch to chips+pretzels+coke, and get chicken broth whenever available!!!

Thoughts:

* stretching is extremely important
* PT exercises once a week are great. Ideally connected with strength training

In July I did 22h of training. It's recommended that all of us do 30mins/day -> 15h/month. I just did extra 7h on top of that!
If you want to do sprint triathlon you can do it with 3.5h/week or less! 2x30 mins run + 1x30 mins swim + 1x1-2h bike ride!

Maybe I'll do Kona after I retire ;)
