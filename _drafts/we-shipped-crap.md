<p>After 4 years since I started working on the new Azure Portal I need to admit it. We shipped crap. We took a huge risk with UI patterns that nobody have ever used, and then we backed off from it. Now, we are trying to become just normal, like every other management website, and it cost a lot.</p>
<p>Maybe we should just start from scratch now? That's not really an option. It's too late. We have 100+ services on Azure, and 1000+ problems solved. Unfortunately our usability, and user friendliness is not great.</p>
<p>Everybody knows that. Don't think that I am the only one. Everybody will admit this! Everybody wouldn't do what we did again.</p>
<p>We have great engineers working on Azure Portal, because guess what - do you want to work on yet another, boring, like every other management website? Or you want to do something different? That's why most of developers from the team chose to work on the new Azure Portal. They wanted do something better than anything else. It just didn't workout that way.</p>
