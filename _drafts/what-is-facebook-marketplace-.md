<p>Earlier this year I joined Facebook Marketplace team to help grow the product.</p>
<p>One of our challenges is awareness. Many people do not know what Facebook Marketplace is, or how to take advantage of it.</p>
<h3>Quick history of Facebook Marketplace</h3>
<p>The origins of Facebook Marketplace started ~7 years ago when Facebook engineers noticed that people were creating Facebook Groups to trade in local communities. At first they built features helping that particular types of groups, like exposing price, better composer support for sale posts, etc.</p>
<p>Eventually the idea of Facebook Marketplace emerged. Separate tab/bookmark with global list of all items, by default filtered to your location. Like craigslist, but easier to manage and browse.</p>
<h3>Why Marketplace?</h3>
<p>Buy &amp; Sell Groups are still a thing. There is however, separate, dedicated place to list your items globally. No need to join group that you do not know about. You can just search for whatever, and you can find it easily.</p>
<p>What's more: listing an item is free!</p>
<p>Does World need Facebook Marketplace? Its adoption says yes. Also I don't think we have efficient and easy to use "Uber for stuff exchange" yet. Currently people mostly use craigslist for such purpose. However, managing your items there kinda sucks. You need to click on unique link that you have only on your email, and when your item expires you don't even know that. Your management console is your email inbox. What's worse, using craigslist on mobile is at least hard. There are some third-party apps, but they are not great. In mobile-first World, and especially in mobile-first countries like South-East Asia, this is a huge problem. Many times an entry barrier.</p>
<p>Another benefit of Fb Marketplace is safety. How many times you were afraid to meet somebody, especially when you were selling expensive item? With Facebook, you can much better track person from whom you buy or sell.</p>
<p>Did you hear about Shark Tank? Majority of entrepreneurs who pitch their products there, when asked, say that they acquire customers on Facebook or Instagram. Kevin O'Leary (AKA Mr Wonderful) said that <a href="https://youtu.be/J-C38UhtdnM?t=283">"Facebook is the largest job creating engine in America"</a> because all of his small businesses acquire customers on Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp. Creating end-to-end platform for these entrepreneurs seems like a logical step.</p>
<p>There is also big part of the World that does not have as good access to commerce as we do in US and Europe. Especially, South-East Asia. Helping to stimulate economy there is exciting opportunity! Sure, there are multiple apps for such purpose on these markets, but they are not positioned as good as Facebook for such purpose. It's not only about user acquisition, but also about connecting shopping with interests that enables better targeting. Do you remember times when 99% of ads you have seen, usually in TV, has been not interesting at all to you? These times are gone, and current tech can show you something that you can actually be interested in!</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>There are tons of places online where you can buy and sell things. Many offers different distinctive features that gives them competitive advantage over each other. How can Marketplace be significant in that World? I think I answered that above. However, understanding this end-to-end picture is much different from the perspective of customer who wants to buy a thing today as fast as they can, as easy as possible, and at the cheapest price. Is Facebook Marketplace always the best way to go? Probably not. Making it so, and thus optimizing people's life is!</p>
