<h2>Hi, I am Jacob!</h2>

I work on GenAI at Meta.

In the past, I worked on [Experimental Products](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/05/meta-testing-livestreaming-platform-influencers-super) and [Facebook Marketplace Growth Team](/growth-handbook/).

Before Meta, I worked for Microsoft where I helped to build the [new Azure Management Portal](/azure-portal-the-largest-single-page-app-in-the-world/), [Azure Management Mobile App](/under-the-hood-of-the-azure-mobile-app/), [Azure Search](/azure-search-on-azure-friday/), and [SeeingAI](/seeing-ai-photo-gallery/).

<!-- I worked at Microsoft on Azure Cloud. I helped to ship the [new Azure Management Portal](/azure-portal-the-largest-single-page-app-in-the-world/) - the first Single Page App using TypeScript. I started [Azure Management Mobile App](/under-the-hood-of-the-azure-mobile-app/), which utill today has higher store ratings than gcloud and AWS mobile apps on both App Store and Google Play. I helped to improve the management console for [Azure Search](/azure-search-on-azure-friday/). In my 10% time, I was helping with [SeeingAI app](/seeing-ai-photo-gallery/) - a mobile app for blind people that recognizes the environment around them. -->

<!-- Before Meta, I worked for Microsoft where I...
- ...helped to build the new Azure Management Portal - one of the largest and most complex web apps at the time. 
- ...started Mobile App for monitoring and managing Azure resources. I took it from Hackathon project to largest Microsoft conference keynote.
- ...helped to grow Azure Search by redesigning and rebuilding web UI, which resulted in increased feature adoption -->

<p>I started and shipped <a href="https://jj09.net/under-the-hood-of-the-azure-mobile-app/">Azure Management Mobile App</a> - mobile companion app that enables you to monitor your Azure resources and take critical actions while on the go.

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify;">Together with <a href="https://mfranc.com/">Michal Franc</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sawiczpawel">Pawel Sawicz</a> I co-founded <a href="http://www.dotnetconf.pl">dotNetConfPL</a> - online conference for .NET Developers.

I love biking and triathlons. [I am an Ironman](/i-am-an-ironman/) and [USA Triathlon National Championships participant](https://track.rtrt.me/e/USAT-AGE_GROUP-2023#/tracker/RV9456DB). My favorite distance is the Olympic triathlon: 1.5k swim + 40k bike + 10k run.

I also enjoy hiking, skiing, soccer, martial arts and sailing.

<!-- <p style="text-align: justify;">Cycling is my passion.
