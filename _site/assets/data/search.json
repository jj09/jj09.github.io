    "content"  : "\n\nMeet Tony &quot;Teddy Bear&quot; Montana. My new family member since October last year.\nI wanted to have a dog for a while, but before COViD I was always on the go. Traveling outside of the city or outside of the country at least once a month. My lifestyle was not good for having a dog. Especially a puppy! However, when COViD hit I thought: now or never. My plan was simple: I’ll get a puppy during COViD, and before the pandemic is over he will be a well trained dog.\nAs raising a puppy is not easy, I decided to journal my experience for the future me and friends. This is not a comprehensive guide as there is a bunch of stuff all over the internet, but I would share my gotchas and notes.\nBefore puppy arrival\nI am all about learning from others and their mistakes. Thus, I read a few books before even getting a dog:\n\nZak George&#39;s Dog Training Revolution - great intro about what having a dog is and how to select the perfect dog breed for you\nThe Art of Raising a Puppy - good set of tips on how to train a puppy from the first days. It has some good ideas about creating a routine for your puppy, etc.\n\nThe Power of Positive Dog Training - comprehensive guide on how to train a dog with step by step instructions for teaching particular commands. I strongly recommend this one, especially after you figure out the basics (potty training, etc.)\n\nAnother things to be aware BEFORE you get a puppy:\n\nfirst days/weeks will be rough - sleepless nights, waking up at 1am, 3am and 5am to take your puppy pee, and constant supervision will be needed\nthe most important is consistency - this is hard, because we humans are not robots; to be most successful with a puppy you need to behave consistently in EVERY situation in order to not confuse him: even getting him food in specific way can be confusing\nThe puppy needs to get used to YOUR schedule - he does not need to go to work, but you do; he does not need to go grocery shopping, but you do; he does not need to take you out, but you need to take him out...you have much more responsibilities than him, and you shouldn&#39;t feel guilty that you are leaving him alone while you are working or taking care of errands\n\nFirst 2 weeks\nIt was a little bit more challenging than expected. I was fortunate that my now fiance helped me throughout this experience!\nFor the first few days you need to sleep next to your puppy&#39;s crate. Yes, you need a crate, otherwise he can do something you don’t want during the night. Like eating things that cannot be taken out without surgery!\nIt’s really helpful to have your significant other, or friend who would help you during this time. It was a game changer for us when one night, one person was sleeping (and waking up) by Tony’s crate, and another was in the bedroom (with earplugs) getting an actual night of sleep. We were alternating every day.\nIt&#39;s also recommended to give a limited space to your puppy, and gradually increase it. Giving him access to the entire house might be overwhelming.\nBesides that you need to start potty training and basic commands (I recommend The Power of Positive Dog Training for that).\nQuick guide to potty training\nOn the day of arrival, take your puppy out every hour. Ideally to the same spot and wait until he pees. Then increase it by 5 mins every other day or so. The rule of thumb is: puppy can hold pee for as many hours as many months old he is. E.g., 3 months old puppy should be able to hold it for 3 hours. However, always start with 1h. Even if the puppy is 3 months old. Then increase time between breaks gradually.\nI recommend increasing the time between pee breaks on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This would add 15mins every week, and ~1h every month. It’s better to not do increases on the weekends as weekends are usually more random than working days.\nRemember, accidents will happen. There is no way around it. They will eventually stop. Just be patient! When accidents happen: just say &quot;no&quot; and immediately take puppy out to usual pee spot.\nFirst commands\nI recommend getting a few sessions with a good dog trainer. You have no idea how the smallest things you do may confuse your dog and be a game changer. Every dog is different, and a few recommendations from an experienced trainer can be a game changer! E.g., our trainer told us: “you are so lucky, your puppy behavior is great for his age…just do not mess him up”.\nPeople do not realize that THEY have to be trained to have a dog as well! If you need recommendations for a good dog trainer in the Seattle area let me know!\nI also recommend a copy of The Power of Positive Dog Training.\nInitially, I was skeptical with treat training as my friend told me that then the dog will never listen to me if I won’t give him treats. However, our trainer proved this to be not necessarily true. Bottom line is: treats are good for training as they cause your dog to associate good feelings with them. You say command, he does something, he gets a nice reward. Remember to have tasty treats! Later on, he will be on autopilot and treats won’t be needed.\nWe spent a good amount of time deciding which commands are most important. If I was doing it all over again I would teach in this order:\n\nhis name (Tony!)\nsit\noff - in the first days he will be jumping at people all the time, sometimes with biting (in a playful way); you don&#39;t want him to have that behavior\nleave it - in first days your puppy will try to pick up pretty much EVERYTHING from the ground, faster he learns this command the better for his health\nwait/stay - we started with stay, but then learned that we need separate commands for: &#39;wait and do not move&#39; and &#39;stay and do not follow me&#39; (e.g., when leaving house); it&#39;s also helpful to show pointing finger as dogs react more to body language than words\ncome\n\nAfter the first few days, when the puppy gets used to the new environment you can start moving your bed further and further away from the crate, or by moving the crate further away from your bed (~1ft/day). We actually skipped that step and just went to the bedroom after 2 weeks. For the first few days Tony was whining, but he eventually stopped.\nWhen he was 3 or 4 months old we let him sleep outside of the crate...and it was just fine. Actually, one night when I was locking the crate I just locked one door (we have 2 doors crate), because I thought the other door was locked, but it wasn&#39;t! At the morning I was wondering why he is not barking (AKA asking to go pee), and found him sleeping by our bedroom door :) After that we knew it&#39;s probably gonna be fine to let him sleep outside of the crate :)\nSocializing\nRemember to first vaccinate your puppy. Avoid dog parks, at least at the beginning. Make them meet the best behaved dogs you know. Tony learned a lot from Porter - my friend&#39;s dog who is the best trained dog I know. It was great when Porter stayed with us for a week. We could just tell him what to do, and Tony would simply follow him! Excellent way to teach with little effort.\nSports\nPuppies should not run until the age of 6 months. We started with hiking (his first hike at the age of 6 months was 5 miles!), and then running (1 mile: 1min walk, 1 min run, 1.5 miles, 2 miles, 3 miles, etc.).\nSwimming is more tricky, as it depends on the breed. Goldendoodles are natural swimmers. Tony’s first swim was when he was in a dog park with Porter (my friend’s dog), and Porter jumped into the water. Tony just followed :P After that we took him for 1h dog SPA where he was swimming in the pool with a trainer. We got him a swim vest and then took him for a 5 min swim (250 yards) at the lake. Then we did 1000 yards, and he was just fine. After that he still had energy to run :O\nOther tips\n\nget pet insurance for the first year – this is the period of time when it’s most likely that something will happen to your puppy. Once you get through the first year that likelihood goes down. Then, again when the dog gets older (10 years or so) it’s worth considering again.\ndo not open crate when he is jumping at the door, wait until he sits and then open crate\nmake him sit before giving food\nwhen puppy jumps at you: turn around\nwhen you want to avoid him jumping at people on the street separate him from others with your body facing him\n\nuseful resources\n\nAmerican Kennel Club - a bunch of resources about dogs, you can sign up for a weekly newsletter with tips on what to do at a particular age (8 weeks, 9 weeks, etc.)\nPuppy Primer - nice, quick read about basic aspects of raising a puppy (from potty training to basic behaviors human should do). You can find my notes from that book on GoodReads\nHow to Behave So Your Dog Behaves - this is very comprehensive guide on how to train your dog. I recommend to pick it up later on, after you went through basic exercises and observed your dog behaviors already. This book will help you to understand why your dog does what he does, and how to adjust nitty gritty details of YOUR daily behaviors.\n\nThis is it for now. I will be updating this when I recall other things or learn some new things.\n\n"

    "content"  : "\nGrowth Hacker (noun) /’grōth ha-kər/: a highly resourceful and creative marketer singularly focused on high-leverage growth. Growth hackers thrive in resource-constrained environments where money is tight and time is of the essence. Through a mix of creativity and technology, a growth hacker is able to hack through the jungle, uncover buried resources along the way, and construct the tools needed to grow a business. A growth hacker is the figure-it-out-as-we-go adventurer of Indiana Jones mixed with the problem-solving ingenuity of MacGyver.\nGrowth Hacking: Silicon Valley&#39;s Best Kept Secret is a good end to end overview what you need to take into account when running (digital) business.\nIt is very simple and trivial, but if you are doing Growth Hacking you need to remember, and remind yourself EVERY DAY that your two primary resources are TIME and MONEY. It is always tradeoff to choose between one of these two, while building a business.\nEntire book describes so-called ASP - Automated Sales Process:\n\nAttraction (Acquisition)\nFirst Impression\nEngage &amp;amp; Educate\nFollow-Up\nSales Technology\nReferrals &amp;amp; Retention\n\nMany times, when working on a product, we tend to forget about some of above elements. Most companies focus on acquisition, but forget about first impression or education. For people working on particular product many things are obvious, but most of them might be not obvious for new customers.\nAttraction (Acquisition)\nHalf the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is, I don’t know which half.\nThis is not a case anymore thanks to Facebook and Google! With Facebook ads you can target males in their 30s who live in Seattle, with income in range of $100-150k/year.\nWhen creating targeting profile, authors recommend to take following customer signals into account:\n\ngender\nage\nprofession\nincome\nliving location\nmartial status\nhaving kids\nhobbies\ninterests\n\nA clever way to determine specifically where your target customer spends time is to use a tool called SimilarWeb. Enter your competitor’s URLs into the tool, and scroll down to see exactly where their website traffic is coming from. This is a great way to discover places to “steal” clients away from your competition.\nThe job of growth hacker is to without spending a dollar more on marketing, acquire the most customers in the least time.\nThe domino theory of growth hacking states that small wins beget progressively larger wins. Your job as a growth hacker is to identify the lead domino, the first tactic to implement, and line up the subsequent dominoes in ascending level of achievability on a path that leads you to your ultimate goal.\nOther acquisition techniques:\n\nThe four primary categories to keep Attraction tactics organized are direct, search platforms, branding platforms, and other.\nA framework for identifying high-ROI Attraction opportunities is called advertising arbitrage: seek advertising opportunities where advertising inventory supply outpaces advertiser demand.\nA strategy for creating cost-efficient advertising opportunities is to marry content creation with commerce.\nCollaboration opportunities exist where your customer base overlaps with a complementary company and is fertile territory for affiliate, joint venture, comarketing, and other similar types of partnership arrangements.\n\nFirst Impression\nMaking first impression is hard, but it&#39;s very important. My takeaway from this section is that you should just look at the best first impression strategies that are out there and use fast follow/copy strategy.\nIt’s far cheaper to stand on the proverbial shoulders of early-adopting giants than reinvent the proverbial wheel. The trick is to figure out whom to follow.\nYou need to be on top of that all the time, and update/evolve your first impression technique ALL THE TIME.\nEngage &amp;amp; Educate\nIn order to maximize the persuasive effect of your communication, you must make all three rhetorical appeals of persuasion:\n\nethos (credibility)\npathos (emotion)\nlogos (logic)\n\nOn top of that, you need USP (Unique Selling Proposition) - succinct summary of what differentiates you from competition.\nUse customer-centric words and phrases to describe your product:\n\nWords to avoid: “we”, “my ”, “us” and “our”\nWords to use: “you” and “your”\n\nSocial proof helps to engage people, because when people are unsure what to do they mimic the actions of others. Especially, if others are people they know or their friends.\nFollow-Up\nOnce you get your customer familiar with your product, you need to remind of yourself.\nFirst step is to get customer information.\nIt&#39;s important to remember that more information you request from your lead, the more friction there is, which leads to the prospect being less likely to provide the requested information.\nInstead of asking explicitly for customer information you can use retargeting campaign using Facebook or Google ads.\nThere is very thin line between being effective and annoying which may result in losing customer. On the other hand, there is the marketing rule of 7.\nThe Marketing Rule of 7 states that a prospect needs to “hear” the advertiser’s message at least 7 times before they’ll take action to buy that product or service.\nAll reach-outs need to follow 4Es:\n\nEngaging\nEducational\nEntertaining\nEmotional\n\nSales Technology\nUpsell - “up” the price by suggesting a more premium product or service.\nCross-sell - encourage you to reach across the aisle and add a complementary product to your order.\nAutomating your online sales require you to build everything by yourself (time) or use existing solutions (money).\nMore you automate, and measure the better results and improvements you can make. E.g., sending upsell/cross-sell emails after purchase or even confirmations can help to increase sales.\nThere is list of recommended tools for automating sales.\nReferrals &amp;amp; Retention\nOnce your customer made the purchase, you need to try to retain him, and encourage to refer your product to others.\nIncreasing client retention increases Customer Lifetime Value. This allows to spend more on acquisition, which opens up new customer acquisition channels that are otherwise unaffordable.\nThe most popular and easy retention technique is to send simple holiday or birthday card. However, authors recommend to send holiday cards on less popular holidays, e.g., “Happy Saint Patrick’s Day” card will be more distinctive and more likely to be read than a New Year “Happy Holidays” card\nWe worked with one of our clients to send a box of See’s chocolates for Valentine’s Day to their top general contractor clients, and they ended up generating more than fifty thousand dollars of contracts from a two - hundred - dollar investment. They also helped several “forgetful” gentlemen look like wonderfully thoughtful husbands when they brought chocolate to their wives on Valentine’s Day.\nThe best time for applying growth-hacking is after the point of initial purchase at the very bottom of the proverbial funnel.\nTestimonial formula: [Specific End Result or Benefit the Customer Received] + [Specific Period of Time] + [Accompanied Customer Emotion] + [Customer Name with Relevant Stats].\nDealing with negative comments, opinions, feedback:\n\nPreempt it through satisfaction surveys and other internal feedback forms\nFor a negative truth: admit, apologize, and promote the opposite\nFor a negative lie: state that the comment is inaccurate or invalid, and substantiate your comment\n\nThe two primary categories of active referral systems are:\n\nfinancial, e.g, get product after referring a friend\nin-kind (non-cash), e.g., encourage to share product with friends, or leave review on social media\n\nSummary\nI really like this book. Although it doesn&#39;t provide direct recipe for growth, it outlines different stages of customer journey very well.\n\nATTRACT thousands of interested new leads.\nCreate a powerful FIRST IMPRESSION to set the tone for a consistent, personalized, and professional experience with your company.\n ENGAGE &amp;amp; EDUCATE your prospects so they have all the information they need to feel comfortable buying from you.\nImplement a seamless FOLLOW-UP process so that no business slips through the cracks and your company is always top-of-mind.\nUse SALES TECHNOLOGY to more efficiently close sales, upsell, and cross-sell products and services.\nGenerate high-value REFERRALS while RETAINING existing clients.\n\nThere is complementary list of resources to dive in more on book authors&#39; website: deviatelabs.com/resources. Especially, check the list of recommended tools for each part of ASP.\nComfort is a death sentence to progress, and progress is what you seek.\n"

    "content"  : "\nIs your &quot;to read&quot; backlog longer than 100 books? Is there more books than you can read in one year? Mine too!\nSolution? Pick top 20, and remove the rest?\nThat&#39;s one way to go, but there is also another one: speed reading.\nI decided to learn a little about speed reading in order to get to some books that I&#39;m curious about, but...not enough to devote a month of reading for them. There are some books I just want to just know what&#39;s in there.\nSpeed reading is also useful for articles. How many times your friends send you things that take 20 minutes to read, and then you are like &quot;meh...I wish I spent this time by going for a walk&quot;?\nHow many times you decided that you want to read something because you are very interested in particular topic? How many times you ended up in reading it, and concluding: &quot;if I could go back in time I wouldn&#39;t read it&quot; or &quot;content was not what I was expecting&quot;? How many times you read something and you think: &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s good, but it can be summarized in 1 paragraph&quot;?\nResources to get started\nHere is a list of good resources I went through to get familiar with speed reading:\n\nBook: Speed Reading: The Comprehensive Guide To Speed Reading - good quick read, 100 pager overview of speed reading\nI Was Wrong About Speed Reading: Here are the Facts - good overview of speed reading, and useful tips\n\nSkim Before You Read\nImprove Your Fluency to Improve Your Speed\nknow what you’re trying to get out of a text before you read it\nhighlight things you want to remember\n\n\nHow To Double Your Reading Speed\n\nRead Classics In The Morning\nHave An End Goal In Mind\nRead The Right Books (classics, how-to, biographies)\nTrick Your Brain To Think Of Reading Like Working Out\nNap After Reading To Retain Memory\n\n\n Skimming And Scanning: Two Important Strategies For Speeding Up Your Reading  - this article talks about two essential techniques of speed reading: scanning and skimming\nFree Speed Reading Video Course (~45 min)\nSpeed Reading by Nathan Kontny - tl;dr - skimming is the key\nScientific Speed Reading: How to Read 300% Faster in 20 Minutes (Tim Ferris) - very structured approach to learn how to quick read\n[FREE] Free Speed Reading Fundamentals Course - my results:\n\nFirst test: 339 (1m)\nSecond test: 581+187 (2m)\nThird: 581+180 (1m30s)\nText2: 269 (1m)\n\n\nHow to speed read by Tim Ferris\n\nfocus on reading middle of each line - ignore 1 inch of beginning and 1 inch of end of the line (watch video for details)\nuse pointer (finger or pen) to follow\nfast read as exercise, then read in normal speed - this should increase reading speed!\n\n\n\nMy approach\nWhen I see something that interests me I do not read it from back to back anymore. I skim first, and if it&#39;s good I read it more carefully, or do another, more comprehensive skim. If it&#39;s a book, I read table of contents first.\nSometimes I also read summary at wikisummaries, fourminutebooks or blinkist.\nAnother heuristic that helps me to make a decision about reading books is to check GoodReads score. If it&#39;s above 4 then it&#39;s promising. Around 4.5 usually end up being very good, worth reading back to back.\nFor storytelling books, like biographies, I usually pick up an audiobook on Libby or Audible. Then I listen to it while making breakfast or home errands.\nFor articles, I usually start with summary/conclusion. Many times that&#39;s where I stop...\nSummary\nIt&#39;s all about skimming.\nIf you want to read fast: skim the words, read first sentence of every paragraph, or even just headers or book/article.\nFaster reading = worse comprehension. The art of speed reading is to find the sweet spot of how much comprehension you are willing to sacrifice for speed of reading.\n"

    "content"  : "\nBack in 2016, after reading Peter Thiel&#39;s Zero to One, I came up with an idea of Underground Package Delivery System. At first it would connect just distribution centers. Then we gonna have local dropbox stations. Like Amazon Lockers. Ultimately: everyone will have dropbox in their homes. You order something on amazon, worker machine sends this to you through underground pipes, you get notification, open dropbox which is next to your closet...and it&#39;s there! Packages will travel like internet packages.\nAt first, everyone was laughing and told me that it is IMPOSSIBLE! Only a few months later, Amazon was granted a patent for that idea.\nI recently discussed this idea with one friend, and decided to re-research it. It looks like a company from UK (Magway) is working on it! Another company, Mole Solutions, has even built 344-foot prototype. They also created awesome video with an overview of the idea:\n\nThis is another video of how it would look like:\n\nAre underground delivery systems realistic options for moving packages quickly?\nMagway estimates that it would cost 6 Million Dollars per mile. This is actually not bad! Compare this with urban rail cost per mile being up to 1 Billion Dollars (source)!\nI know that majority of people see the future in drones, but...do you really want to have entire sky polluted with packages?\n\nThere is one man, who really believes in tunnels. You know who that is ;) Hint.\nWhat do you think?\n"

    "content"  : "I decided to write this post, because before joining Facebook I thought that PHP is just old, limited language from 2 decades ago when server was responsible for simple form parsing, and generating HTML.\nI actually learned web development using PHP in mid-2000s, when I was in middle school. I created my personal blog, and website about very popular back then game Deluxe Ski Jump. I actually still have the source code and recently put it on Azure at dsjonine.azurewebsites.net - it is in polish, and there is no database:P Didn&#39;t bother to update character encoding from ISO-8859-2 to UTF. Why I used ISO-8859-2? Because my cousin told me to do so! It was real copy/paste programmer back then! Good times :D\nMark Zuckerberg wrote first version of Facebook around that time using PHP too. LAMP stack was the way to go for web development in 2000s.\nA few days after joining facebook I realized that PHP now is full blown OO language. It has classes, interfaces, abstract classes, dependency injection, etc. It is much closer to C# or Java than to PHP that I used to write 15 years ago. At facebook we use Hack (typed PHP). It&#39;s awesome. You have the best of two Worlds: type safety and no compilation! Just save, and refresh to see your changes. Yay! As pure PHP performance is not the best, HHVM performance is an improvement.\nIn PHP, you can access pretty much every module in the codebase without explicitly referencing it. That&#39;s an extra productivity boost. Or hack:) Intellisense in editors like Nuclide (Atom) or VSCode is pretty good as well. When you add Facebook engineering systems, where everything is so neatly setup to prioritize productivity, you are in heaven :) I know most of PHP devs do not have that luxury, but just sayin&#39; ;)\nIf you want to learn more about modern PHP, check out these resources:\n\nPHP the right way\nModern PHP book\n25 years of PHP (by the Creator of PHP)\nHack and HHVM book\n\nAs of February 2020, PHP is 5th most popular language on StackOverflow (source)! Just recently taken over by python.\nIn any means I am not recommending you to learn PHP if you don&#39;t have to. Choose Rust or Go instead! Just wanted to let you know, that PHP changed A LOT! PHP in 2020 is not PHP from Web 1.0 times.\n"

    "content"  : "\nSome time ago, Remo Jansen recommended me to check out awesome book Hello, Startup by Yevgeniy Brikman. I finally got into it, and I need to admit that it is a gem describing startup and tech World end-to-end.\nHere are my key take aways:\n\nBuilding successful company requires give or take 10 years (this is short overview why from other source).\nThese 10 years are not 955 work weeks, it&#39;s 996 on the good days.\nTip: Have a notebook to write down any idea that comes to your mind. Even the most stupid one! You will be surprised when a few years later someone turn it into the product. Someone, but not you.\nNew business recipe: copy, transform, combine.\nInitial startup idea requires many iterations. Always! Yevgeniy gives a lot of simple examples including creating resume (from very raw to very nice looking).\nDoing things that don&#39;t scale is ok at the beginning to validate the idea, you can automate later. Launching business that automates something? Hire vendors that would do it manually, and once it take off hire developers who will automate it. As automation and scaling is usually much more expensive.\nMetrics to track:\n\nacquisition - its sources, conversions and cost\nactivation - how many new users engage with the product, and why\nretention - how many users stays after week, month, year...\nreferral - channels and conversions\nrevenue - month over month, year over year, CLV (Customer Lifetime Value)\nmagic number - e.g. once facebook user connects with 7 friends within 10 days they usually become highly engaged, for twitter it takes following 30 people, and for Slack - exchanging 2000 messages (how to find insights like that by Andrew Chen)\n\n\nData-Driven Development: idea -&amp;gt; develop MVP -&amp;gt; A/B Test -&amp;gt; Release (requires well defined metrics and measurement tools)\nDistribution channels for startups:\n\nword of mouth\n\nbuild better product\ngreat customer service\nbuild viral loops into your product\n\n\nmarketing\n\nadvertising\nPR and media\nemail\nSEO\nsocial media\ninbound marketing - e.g., publishing useful blog posts, like Facebook engineering blog\n\n\nsales\n\nautomated - website checkout\ninside - sales representatives at the store, or by phone\noutside - &quot;traveling salesmen&quot;\n\n\nbranding (Apple = &quot;Think different&quot;, Red Bull = extreme sports, Nike = great athletes)\n\n\nUse OSS and buy SaaS solutions for everything, but your competitive advantage (&quot;secret sauce&quot;).\nAlign tech stack with current market trends (in 2020 it&#39;s much easier to hire React developer than Backbone developer).\nAgainst Joel Spolsky opinion that rewrite is worst thing you can do, these days startups often change technologies (Twitter migration from RoR to Scala, Coursera moved from PHP to Scala or AirBnB is moving from React Native to pure native). Thus do not worry too much about stack choice - treat it as it will eventually be rewritten. Microservice architecture over monolith helps with that!\nKeep code clean! Good naming, conventions, DRY, SRP, tests. It can bite even within first year. Especially because at  Startup you will be constantly evolving existing code!\nCompany culture (mission and values) helps to avoid processes. People can trust each other to do the right thing.\nFirst 5-10 hires can kill or make your company successful. Look for: &quot;smart and get things done&quot;, culture fit, communication skills and &quot;would you be ok reporting to them?&quot;.\n\nThis book is GOLD! I strongly recommend everyone to read it. Besides awesome 360 overview of startup World, there is a lot of great insights into everyday developer&#39;s life. It&#39;s worth to remember that pretty much every tech company is a startup...just in different phase.\nIf you are still in doubt, this book has 4.9/5 rating on Amazon and 4.45/5 on goodreads!\nThere is one quote from the book that I would like to finish this summary with:\nI started asking, ``What are the important problems of your field?&#39;&#39; And after a week or so, ``What important problems are you working on?&#39;&#39; And after some more time I came in one day and said, ``If what you are doing is not important, and if you don&#39;t think it is going to lead to something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?&#39;&#39;\nRichard Hamming, You and Your Research\n"

That happens too.\nMaybe I&#39;m the luckiest employee in the World, but over 7 years I didn&#39;t have boss that sucked. Did I work with some people who didn&#39;t like me? Probably, but I was always focused on solving problems, and cared less about their personal feelings. It also happened to me that I didn&#39;t get promotion/bonus when I deserved it. However, after digging in, I understood why, and it was because of constraints others operated in.\nA few years ago, while learning about AI from Peter Norvig (director of research at Google), I learned about Paradox of Rationality - people making rational decisions often end up with worse outcome if they would make irrational decisions. This is foundation of game theory, and obviously happens in life. Did you see irrational outcome coming out of congress lately? Do you think it&#39;s because politicians are stupid?

    "content"  : "After 5 years at Microsoft I joined company, which product I&#39;ve been using for last 12 years :O\n\nBefore I forget how amazing it was, I wanted to drop a few lines about Facebook Engineering Bootcamp.\nWhen you are about to join typical company you have to make a decision whether it&#39;s a good fit for you. Usually it&#39;s based on 4 or 5, hour long LeetCode sessions with different members of the team. Of course you talk to your future manager, HR is telling you how great it&#39;s gonna be etc.\nFacebook does it differently! Your are being interviewed by people from different teams across the company. Not necessary from the team that you are going to join. It&#39;s actually very unlikely that you gonna end up working with any of them. This allows to remove bias, and make interviewing a fair game. Microsoft and Amazon have huge variation between teams. Somebody who wouldn&#39;t pass interview in one team can be a rockstar in other team.\nAfter you pass the interview and join Facebook, you start as bootcamper. You have usually 6-8 weeks to learn facebook engineering systems, and to find a team. You can to talk to as many teams in the company as you want. These are not interviews, but informal chats. Usually short 30 mins meeting, quick coffee or lunch. Some people call it &quot;Facebook Dating&quot; :D\nOnce you determine that there is &quot;chemistry&quot; between you and your future manager, or somebody from the team, then you usually work with that team for a couple of days or a week. Like a real work! They give you desk in their open space area, you get some easy task that is related to what they are working on, and you are a team member for the time being.\nDon&#39;t worry about good and bad teams. At Facebook there are only different teams :) I was surprised how everybody I met during bootcamp had slightly different interests and all of us decided to join different teams :O\nUsually you want to &quot;try&quot; a few teams to have comparison, and to make connections that might help you in the future. E.g., when you will need to work with different team, or when you will be changing teams. This is the best part of the bootcamp. You can literally give you future job a trial run.\nI graduated from bootcamp last week and joined Facebook Marketplace Growth team.\nI&#39;ll probably drop a few lines about Facebook Engineering systems in separate post, but I&#39;ll just tell you this: imagine that you can have all your wishes regarding engineering systems fulfilled, and it&#39;s better than that :)\nIf you want to learn more about bootcamp check this note :)\n"

    "content"  : "\nAfter hearing about Aggregates and Bounded Contexts over, and over again, I decided to check out what Domain-Driven Design is all about. There is a ton of DDD resources on the Internet, but this blog post is for my personal reference. I am publishing it so I can google it, and maybe you find it useful as well. This post is about what DDD is, and how it can help you to write better code.\nWhat is DDD?\nAccording to Wikipedia:\nDomain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to software development for complex needs by connecting the implementation to an evolving model. The premise of domain-driven design is the following:\n\nplacing the project&#39;s primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;\nbasing complex designs on a model of the domain;\ninitiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.\n\n\nMore pragmatic (and ignorant) definition: DDD is software development approach that focus on business processes over implementation details. This allows developers to work with business people more effectively. It also makes code more maintainable and extendable.\nMost important DDD terms (buzzwords):\n\nUbiquitous Language - using business terms for naming classes, methods and variables\nDomain - functionality of the system\nBounded Context - components used to deliver a functionality (AKA domains)\nValue Object - simple, immutable class representing some business term\nEntity - class with unique identifier, usually used to represent persistent data\nAggregate - group of entities\nRepository - class used to save and retrieve aggregate (AKA save/retrieve data to/from database)\nApplication Service - your Domain(s) communication layer\nAnti-corruption layer - layer for interaction with external (or legacy) system\nCQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) - separates querying for data from modifying data\nEvent Sourcing - storing changes to application state as a list of events, which allows to invoke and process events in producer/consumer fashion\n\nResources to learn about Domain-Driven Design\nThere are two DDD bibles: Blue Book and Red Book. I&#39;ve been told to do not read Blue Book as first introduction to DDD, because it&#39;s very &quot;heavy&quot; and hard to understand. People were right. I would also add: it&#39;s not very well written (shoot me for criticizing DDD God AKA Eric Evans).\nList of recommended resources, sorted in order that I would recommend to follow if you are new to DDD. I strongly recommend positions in bold!\n\nDomain Driven Design Fundamentals (Pluralsight) - this will give you an idea what DDD is, perfect to watch during short flight in 2x speed\nDomain-Driven Design Distilled (Vaughn Vernon) - overview of key ideas from Blue Book, this will help you to put all, high-level pieces together\nDomain Driven Design Quickly (thanks Michal Franc) - similar to DDD Distilled, but use even more systematic approach to outline DDD concepts\nDomain-Driven Design in Practice (Pluralsight) - this course shows how to actually use DDD in a project; course author Vladimir Khorikov has a blog Enterprise Craftsmanship, which is very good source of DDD and general Software Development knowledge\nDomain-Driven Design: Working with Legacy Projects (Pluralsight) - another course from Vladimir Khorikov that is a nice demonstration of transforming legacy projects into DDD-friendly architecture\nImplementing DDD &quot;Red Book&quot; (Vaughn Vernon) - comprehensive overview of DDD\nDomain-Driven Design &quot;Blue Book&quot; (Eric Evans) - the Bible of DDD, use it as a reference rather than reading from back to back\n\nNotice that I placed Blue Book at the end. It&#39;s hard to absorb. It also suffers from low knowledge/pages ratio.\nThere is also  Domain-Driven Design path on Pluralsight that has nice set of courses around DDD and software design.\nMy thoughts on DDD\nBefore diving into DDD I was expecting to learn about something new and revolutionary. After reading about Ubiquitous Language, Aggregates and Bounded Context I still didn&#39;t see much difference between DDD and good, SOLID software design. It feels like DDD is mostly about good object-oriented design presented in particular, formalized way with specific buzzwords (aggregate, bounded context, etc.). In Uncle Bob&#39;s Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#, there is the Payroll Case Study example that is following clean code, good design and implementation practices. If you were put that example into DDD book...it would fit. If you take examples from DDD books and put it into Uncle Bob&#39;s book...it would fit fine as well.\nThere are however, some new concepts introduced by DDD. Such as Repository pattern, CQRS or Event Sourcing. Are last two actually DDD? Or they are just related to DDD?\nDDD is also enforcing designing system around business domain, not around, e.g. database. That is usually a case when designing architecture from scratch quickly. As 99% of apps are CRUDs, ending up with database driven architectures would be natural. You usually start with file-&amp;gt;new project, and go from there. This is not a problem for small apps, but might strike later when evolving the app. DDD solves that problem.\nIf you are familiar with Clean Code and SOLID design as presented in Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C# then DDD does not bring much new concepts to the table. It may make you think more from a business perspective, and consider using new patterns (Repository pattern, CQRS or Event Sourcing) though.\nIt&#39;s worth to notice that even if you look at Domain-Driven Design path on Pluralsight, there are non-DDD courses about good/clean design as part of the path. Thus, good design is prerequisite of DDD. On top of that we have mentioned earlier buzzwords, CQRS and Event Sourcing.\nGoing back to DDD terms (AKA buzzwords), they could be also summarized as follows:\n\nUbiquitous Language - use meaningful names for classes, methods and variables\nDomain - be aware what problem you are solving\nBounded Context - group objects that depends on each other\nValue Object - simple, immutable class\nEntity - class with unique identifier, usually used to represent persistent data\nAggregate - group of related entities\nRepository - facade over your persistence layer to make it implementation agnostic\nApplication Service - your system&#39;s API\nAnti-corruption layer - layer for interaction with external system\nCQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) - separates querying for data and modifying data\nEvent Sourcing - storing changes to application state as a list of events, which allows to invoke and process events in producer/consumer fashion\n\nWhat DDD enforces from the beginning is layered architecture that may not always be needed. Should you follow DDD in your projects? The answer is, as always, &quot;it depends&quot;. There are some good ideas there, but being over obsessed with favoring DDD in your design decisions over pragmatism will lead to over-engineering.\nAfter TDD and BDD there is DDD. Should you use DDD in all your projects? No. It&#39;s just a way to design software. Also: using DDD does not mean that you need to use all patterns from Blue Book and Red Book.\nIt seems like DDD should definitely help in long term, but over-engineering (with CQRS and Event Sourcing) may unnecessary complicate things. Actually, I should say: writing SOLID code would help you...and here we are again: is DDD really something different than just good software design?\n"

    "content"  : "\nIt&#39;s been almost a year since I joined Azure Search team. A lot has changed since then. I joined right after team doubled by merge with Text Analytics team with a mission to add intelligence to search. A few months later entire Cognitive Services (Azure Machine Learning APIs) platform team joined us. Then we hired additional developers to build scalable platform for both Cognitive Services and Azure Search. After that we also got a team of data scientists who are building the actual machine learning models. Now, as the Applied AI team, we are in the center of AI and Cloud at Microsoft.\nAzure Search is a search-as-a-service cloud solution that gives developers APIs and tools for adding a rich search experience in web and mobile applications. You get for free things like autocomplete, suggestions, synonyms, results highlighting, facets, filters, sorting and paging. Functionality is exposed through REST API or .NET SDK. The biggest pain, which is infrastructure and availability are managed by us.\n\nWhile having all of that, we also need a great developer experience. Everybody needs to be able to understand how to build that Search AI pipeline without spending hours on reading docs. This is another thing we are working on. Email me or tweet message me if you are interested in that kind of stuff.\nWhere are we going?\n\nWe want to build the best Search as a Service platform that enables developers to add Bing-like Google-like search experience to their websites. No need for hiring search experts who know what inverted index is. No challenges with shard allocation and how to implement master election properly. No need for distributed systems expertise to scale this for large amount of data. Last, but not least: no need for setting up, owning and managing the infrastructure. Everything is being taken care of by the platform. By the Cloud.\nOur team is also working on market-leading Machine Learning APIs. We are going to utilize these ML models and enable you to search through not only text, but also through your images, audio and videos.\nThere is a lot of challenges in that journey. From processing large amounts of data, through doing it in reasonable time (performance/parallelization), to providing efficient user experience throughout the process.\nWhere are we now?\nWe already have fast, reliable and production-ready system for full-text search. You can provision it in no-time, scale by adding more replicas or partitions, and monitor using metrics we provide. You can query it with .NET SDK or using REST API. We even have Open Source UI generation tool that gets you started with the latter: AzSearch.js.\nTo learn more about current capabilities of Azure Search check this awesome presentation by Bryan Soltis:\n\nThere are two ways to populate your search index: by simply inserting documents (records) into it, or by using indexer - a mechanism that enables you to sync your search index with your data source (SQL or NoSQL Database, blob storage, etc.).\nWe have already started adding AI to our search pipeline, by enabling you to run text analytics and OCR on your data. If you are using indexer, you can create a skillset, which can detect people, entities, organizations, locations, key phrases, and language on the textual data. On top of that you can use OCR that can recognize text from your images, and enable you to search through that text. You can also run mentioned text analytics on recognized text. We call this approach Cognitive Search. Here is a quick video by Brian and Corom from our team, with a sneak peak of what&#39;s possible:\n\nLast year we created a prototype of Cognitive Search, using JFK files that went public. You can check out our JFK files website, github repo and below video from Connect(); conference in 2017, where Corom explaines how he built a pipeline to achieve what is possible now with just checking the checkbox:\n\nWe announced Cognitive Search at the //build conference earlier this year. Together with NBA we built a website that allows you to search through player&#39;s photos. You can search for players, their shoes or correlations between them:\n\nSimilar approach can be used for variety of different scenarios. From filtering your family photos, through analyzing medical records data, to deciding which crypto-currency to buy. Now, all these PDFs and doc documents you have on your hard drive can be used to make an informed business decision.\nThere are a lot of companies using Azure Search in production. It&#39;s super exciting for me that Real Madrid is using Azure Search. It&#39;s my favorite football club since I was a kid.\nHow&#39;s the team?\nMy favorite thing about our team are the people. Every single person is bringing something else to the table, and there is something you can learn from each one of them. From distributed systems expertise, through API design, to building efficient monitoring infrastructure that enables to maintain production cloud service. One of our team members is Henrik Frystyk Nielsen who is best known for his pioneering work on the World Wide Web and subsequent work on computer network protocols. Currently he works on encapsulating Machine Learning models into containers. Our manager, Pablo Castro started not only Azure Search, but also OData protocol and LINQ to Entities. Our Project Manager Lance Olson was one of the founders of the .NET! You can check out what people say about our team on blind! Search for &quot;Azure Search&quot; ;) There is also a blog post written by Pablo a few years ago: Startup at Microsoft. A lot has changed since then. We went through a few rounds of &quot;funding&quot;, and our team grew. However, we still believe in core values expressed there. For example: every engineer from the team still talks to customers on daily basis either through social media or directly over email or Skype.\nBTW: We are hiring!\n"

    "content"  : "\nSeeing AI is a mobile app that narrates the world around you. It enables people with low vision to recognize faces, objects, text, bills, colors, and much more! Seeing AI was first announced at //build conference in 2016.\nOver last few months I was working with Seeing AI team overnight on in-app Photo Gallery that allows you to browse through photos that you have taken earlier. Before you could only take photo, analyze it, and save (without description). Now, you can save it with description that you can later retrieve. You can also analyze photos taken with your phone camera.\n\nOne of the challenges was to decide what details about the photo should we present. We have a lot of different channels (short text, document, person, scene, etc.). For now we decided to show scene description, place and date when photo was taken. Let us know if you have suggestions to improve this!\n\nAnother problematic part was deciding how to distinguish between analyzed, and not analyzed photos. Initially we had a toggle to switch between recognized photos and all photos. Ultimately we decided to have only 1 view with all photos. Thoughts?\nFor non recognized photos we needed to provide mechanism to analyze them. Initially user had to open photo, and explicitly tap &#39;analyze&#39;. We changed this approach to automatically analyze not recognized photos when going to full screen view, and enable users to reanalyze them. The &#39;reanalyze&#39; button might be useful in situations where we update app with new AI models. These models may do better job in recognizing photos.\nSeeing AI is built with Xamarin iOS native. I was surprised that we had to build entire gallery from scratch. There was no plugin or open source sample we could use. Hint: opportunity for you!\nYou can download Seeing AI from App Store.\n"

    "content"  : "\nEarlier this year I attended QCon Beijing and QCon Sao Paulo conferences. I really like QCon, because there is no marketing, just real experts exchange of experience. After my first QCon (Shanghai in 2016) I was very excited to come back this year!\nQCon Beijing\nCognitive Search\nI delivered talk about Building web apps with Cloud and AI. I showed how to build intelligent web apps with Azure Search and Cognitive Services (Azure Machine Learning APIs). We call this approach Cognitive Search. In my demo I showcased how you can determine which crypto currencies to buy using sentiment analysis on tweets. I streamed tweets to Event Hub, which triggers Azure Function that calls Text Analytics API to calculate sentiment of tweet. I store tweets and its sentiments in SQL Database. I also created Azure Search index to be able to effectively search through tweets. This index is being syncronized with SQL DB through integrated change tracking, and Azure Search indexer that runs on schedule.\n\nI built UI using AzSearch.js (UI generation tool for Azure Search indexes), ASP.NET Core and TypeScript (BTW: there is a lot of cool stuff in TypeScript these days!).\n\nIn addition to search interface I also created aggregation chart comparing sentiments between different cryptos:\n\nSource code is on github: crypto-search.\nVideo from my talk:\n\nMy talk was very well received. Attendees were assessing talks with green (great talk), yellow (ok talk) and red (bad talk) cards. I got 117 green, 9 yellows and 0 reds.\nConference\nI had a great opportunity to meet a lot of engineers and architects from leading tech companies from around the World.\nMads Torgersen (the architect of C# language) shared future plans for C#. It was surprising for me how few people attended his talk. Sisie Xia and Chris Coleman from LinkedIn delivered a great talk about facing challenge of growth, and how they tackle it using their in-house tool Redliner. Julius Volz shared insights about Prometheus monitoring system.\nMajority of talks were in Chinese. I went to Peng Xing&#39;s talk about how they develop Progressive Web Apps at Baidu. I was able to gather 60% of content, but got the essence by talking to him directly. I spent most of my time talking to people in the hallways. It was very eye opening to meet engineers from Chinese cloud giants. China cloud market is dominated by Alibaba Cloud (AliCloud), Baidu and Tencent. Azure and AWS have small market share. Google does not exists in China at all. Alibaba (largest online retailer in China) has even ambitions to overtake AWS in near future. It is worth to notice that Alibaba is Chinese equivalent of Amazon. At the same time people consider Baidu being Chinese Google, and Tencent (who owns WeChat) to be like Facebook. I had an opportunity to chat with Lu from Alibaba Cloud and Wang Yao (Head of IaaS at Baidu). After talking to them, and other engineers I would describe both companies&#39; stack in 3 Words: MacBook, Java and Go. This might be ignorant generalization, but almost every other engineer from big 3 (AliCloud, Baidu, Tencent) that I talked to was either writing code in Java or golang (using Mac of course). I also learned about Alibaba&#39;s Search as a Service: OpenSearch. Something to keep eye on when they will be expanding to USA and Europe market.\nThe most popular track was of course Blockchain. Room was overflowed for the entire day:\n\nChina Tech\nEvery time when I visit China I am impressed by their progress. Highways superior to US interstates, fast trains between all major cities, and now - mobile payments adoption everywhere. Today, in China, most people use WeChat or AliPay. Sometimes cashier can get mad at you if you want to pay cash or credit card, because you cause inconvenience. Scanning QR code is 10x faster! You can even tip a waiter with your mobile phone!\n\nLast year in Seattle we had three bike-sharing companies, and everybody here thinks that we are at the edge of innovation. By the end of 2017 Beijing had 60 bike-sharing companies. Many of them started in 2016. During my visit I learned that China have engineers dominated government. Maybe this explains their progress?\nIf you are going to China, it is useful to have these 3 apps:\n1. WeChat - Chinese facebook, for communication with other Chinese people, and exchanging contacts\n2. DiDi - Chinese Uber\n3. AliPay - for mobile payments (currently WeChat payments requires Chinese ID and account in Chinese Bank)\nIt was also great to meet China division of Cognitive Services team!\n\nTrip to China inspired me to read a book comparing Chinese and Western culture in the World of innovation and progress:\n\nThere is a lot of things that these two Worlds can learn from each other.\nQCon Sao Paulo\nCognitive Search\nTwo days before my talk in Brazil, we officially announced Cognitive Search built in into Azure Search. You do not have to create Cognitive Service anymore. You do not have to write code that orchestrate processing data, and calling API. We do it for you. All what you have to do is to check the checkbox. More details here.\n\nI extended my demo of crypto analysis based on tweets by adding sentiment analysis on news articles. A while ago we put news on Azure Search index. We filtered out news related to cryptos, and put it on Azure Blob storage. We also improved our JFK files demo, and now you can deploy it by yourself by following instructions in this github repo.\nVideo from my talk:\n\nUsually during my talk I ask if somebody ever deployed ElasticSearch and how long did it take. In China one guy said it was ~2 weeks. In Brazil there was one guy who said: 6 months(!) :) That&#39;s why you don&#39;t want this to be your problem. Azure Search takes care of deployment, availability and upgrades for you.\nMy talk was pretty well received in Brazil as well. I got 148 green, 15 yellow and 0 red cards.\nConference\nQCon Sao Paulo had very diverse mix of experts from all around the World. Starting with Aaron Stannard (co-founder of AKKA.NET), Nicholas Matsakis (from Rust core team), and Rodrigo Kumpera (architect and top contributor of mono project), through Michelle Casbon (now Engineer in Google Cloud Platform focused on machine learning and big data tools), Ben Lesh (RxJS Lead at Google), and Martin Spier (performance engineer at Netflix) to Soups Ranjan (Director of Data Science at Coinbase*), Amanda Casari (Data Scientist at SAP Concur), and Piper Niehaus (Elm lang passionate).\nThe most interesting thing I learned at QCon Sao Paulo was how different companies struggle with monitoring, telemetry and system malfunction detection. They all have very sophisticated automation, but it is still not enough in today&#39;s World complexity. As systems we build have more, and more complex architecture, we need to build even better monitoring software to maintain them.\nIn Azure Search we are using OData standard. However, recently GraphQL is gaining popularity. Dan McGhan shared this article about comparing GraphQL and OData: REST API Industry Debate: OData vs GraphQL vs ORDS. Interesting read!\nBrazil\nMay is almost winter in Brazil, but it&#39;s also the best time to visit. Not too hot, not too cold. Perfect weather for enjoying your time!\nI like that every bar and restaurant in Brazil have TV on soccer channel :) As a long standing fan of Brazil national football team (since Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima times) I enjoyed it a lot!\nSao Paulo, the largest city in Brazil (21 million people) and financial center of the country, is also the largest tech-hub in south America. Most of tech-companies are there (Microsoft, Google, Amazon).\nIf you ever go to Brazil, remember to visit Sugarloaf to watch the sunset and after the sunset view :)\n\nSummary\nSpeaking at QCons and connecting with engineers from different backgrounds is very valuable experience. Being able to learn about other cultures is a plus as well. Sharing with other work that you do everyday can also give you different perspective, and notice things that you would never think about.\nIf you want to learn more about Azure Search check out our getting started docs. To create intelligent search pipelines check out my Cognitive Search blog post. For more details we have quickstart and more comprehensive API overview.\nQuestions?

    "content"  : "\nEarlier this year I had a pleasure to speak at Wroc# conference in Poland. It was very well organized event that was almost free for attendees. The only cost was required donation to charity: PLN 150 (~$50).\nThere was only 1 track with awesome speakers lineup! I finally had an opportunity to meet Roy Osherove in person. I learned about unit testing from his book The Art of Unit testing. I&#39;m currently reading his another book: Elastic Leadership - a lot of useful tips not only for team leaders! Among other speakers there were Scott Helme (Security Researcher) that uncovered some things about web security I have never heard about! Zan Kavtaskin gave great overview about building apps on Azure Cloud, Glenn Henriksen showed how on server-less computing works in Real-World, and Sander Hoogendoorn together with Kim van Wilgen shared their perspective on over-engineering development processes.\nThe conference venue was great. I would say it was the best setup I&#39;ve even seen! There was one big room, divided into 3 parts: stage, chairs for audience and Mix&amp;amp;Mingle zone (AKA M&amp;amp;M). You could talk (in the Mix&amp;amp;Mingle zone), and still be able to follow presentations. Speakers&#39; room was on the upper floor, but it was more like a balcony, from where you could listen to talks and overlook entire venue.\nI delivered talk about building mobile apps with Xamarin. I shared what we have learned while building Azure Mobile App, which started as hackathon project, and later turned into official Microsoft product. The app got announced on the stage of //build conference last year. Along the way we learned how to properly architect Xamarin project for multiple platforms, where to do not take shortcuts, does and don&#39;ts for CI/CD and testing. \n\nThere was a guy who put a nice summary of my talk:\n\nAt the end of the conference there was speaker&#39;s panel where we were answering and discussing questions from the audience. We had good discussion about different aspects of software development from estimating project cost to writing unit tests. Almost every speaker had different background, and this made it even more interesting!\n\n\nIf you haven&#39;t been to Poland before: Wroclaw is an amazing city, and many of my foreign friends says it&#39;s their favorite city in Poland. Wroclaw is often refereed as WrocLove ;)\n\nLast, but not least: thank you for everyone who made this conference happen!\n\n"

    "content"  : "\nToday, at Microsoft //build conference we announced Cognitive Search. You may wonder what is Cognitive Search. To put it as simple as possible: it’s Azure Search powered by Cognitive Services (Azure Machine Learning APIs). You remember when you wanted to run some intelligence over your data with Cognitive Services? You had to handle creating, e.g., Text Analytics API, then writing code that would take your data from database, issue request to API (remember to use proper key!), serialize, deserialize data and put result in your database?\nNow, with Cognitive Search, you can achieve that by checking one checkbox. You just need to pick a field on which you want to run analytics, and which cognitive services or skills (1 cognitive service usually contain multiple skills) to run. As for now we support 6 skills:\n\nKey phrases\nPeople\nPlaces\nOrganizations\nLanguage\nOCR (Optical Character Recognition)\n\nWe output results directly to your search index.\nCreating Intelligent Search Index\nTo take advantage of Cognitive Search you need to create Azure Search service in South-Central US or in West Europe. More regions coming soon!\nTo create search index powered by cognitive services you need to use ‘import data’ flow. Go to your Azure Search Service and click on ‘Import data’ command:\n\nThen pick your data source (MSSQL, CosmosDB, blob storage etc.). I will choose sample data source that contains real estate data:\n\nNow, you need to pick a field on which you want to run analytics. I will choose description. You also need to choose which cognitive services (skills) you want to run, and provide output field names (fields to which we will output cognitive services analysis result):\n\nIn the next step you need to configure your index. Usually you want to make fields retrievable, searchable, and filterable. You may also consider making them facetable if you want to aggregate results. This is my sample configuration:\n\nIn the last step you just need to configure indexer – a tool that synchronizes your data source with your search index. In my case I will choose to do synchronization only once, as my sample data source will never change.\n\nAfter indexer finish you can browse your data, and cognitive services results in search explorer.\n\nYou can also generate more usable search UI for your data with AzSearch.js.\nGenerating UI to search data with AzSearch.js\nIf you don’t like browsing your data with search explorer in Azure Portal that returns raw JSON, you can use AzSearch.js to quickly generate UI over your data.\nThe easiest way to get started is to use AzSearch.js generator. Before you start, enable CORS on your index:\n\nOnce you get your query key and index definition JSON paste it into generator together with your search service name, and click &#39;Generate&#39;. An html page with simple search interface will be created.\n\nThis site is super easy to customize. Providing html template for results change JSON into nicely formatted search results:\n\nAll what I did was to create HTML template:\n\nconst resultTemplate =\n    `&amp;lt;div class=&quot;col-xs-12 col-sm-5 col-md-3 result_img&quot;&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive result_img&quot; src=&quot;{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2018/05/{{thumbnail}}&quot; alt=&quot;image not found&quot; /&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;div class=&quot;col-xs-12 col-sm-7 col-md-9&quot;&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;{{displayText}}&amp;lt;/h4&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;div class=&quot;resultDescription&quot;&amp;gt;\n            {{summary}}\n        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;\n            sqft: &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;{{sqft}}&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;\n            beds: &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;{{beds}}&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;\n            baths: &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;{{baths}}&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;\n            key phrases: &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;{{keyPhrases}}&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;`;\n    \n\nAnd add it to already present addResults function call:\n\nautomagic.addResults(&quot;results&quot;, { count: true }, resultTemplate);\n\nI also created resultsProcessor to do some custom transformations. I.e., join few fields into one, truncate description to 200 characters, and convert key phrases from array into string separated by commas:\n\nvar resultsProcessor = function(results) {\n    return results.map(function(result){\n        result.displayText = result.number + &quot; &quot; + result.street+ &quot; &quot; +result.city+ &quot;, &quot; +result.region+ &quot; &quot; +result.countryCode;\n        var summary = result.description;\n        result.summary = summary.length &amp;amp;lt; 200 ? summary : summary.substring(0, 200) + &quot;...&quot;;\n        result.keyPhrases = result.keyphrases.join(&quot;, &quot;);\n        return result;\n    });\n};\nautomagic.store.setResultsProcessor(resultsProcessor);\n\nYou can do similar customization with suggestions. You can also add highlights to your results and much more. Everything is described in AzSearch.js README. We also have starter app written with TypeScript and React based on sample real estate data, which takes advantage of more advanced features of AzSearch.js. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding AzSearch.js let me know on Twitter!\nSummary\nCognitive Search takes analyzing data with Azure Search to the next level. It takes away the burden of writing your own infrastructure for running AI-based analysis. For more advanced analysis, including OCR on your images, check out our docs. I am super excited to see it in action, and for the next improvements that we are working on. Let us know what do you think!\n*This blog post was written in Boeing 787 during my flight from Toronto to São Paulo, when I was on my way to QCon conference.\n"

    "content"  : "\nIt has been over 3 years since I joined the Azure Portal team. During that time I learned a lot about every aspect of web and mobile development. I delivered over 20 technical talks at different conferences around the World and local meetups. It was amazing to take the new Portal from preview to v1. In the meantime, during the //oneweek hackathon, together with a few other folks, we built a prototype of the Azure Mobile App. After getting feedback from Scott Guthrie who said that &quot;it would be super useful&quot; I started working on the app overnight.\nI didn&#39;t know much about mobile development at the time, but I wanted to learn. I didn&#39;t know much about complexities of Active Directory authentication and Azure Resource Manager APIs. I just knew that it would be super cool to have an app that would allow me to check the status of my Azure resources while waiting for my lunch. Receiving a push notification, and being able to scale VM from my phone would be also tremendously valuable.\nWhen I started working on the app full time, my dream came true. I could truly connect my passion with work. I enjoyed the long hours, and late nights we all put to make it happen. The day when Scott Hanselman presented the Azure App at the //build conference was on of the best days of my life.\nNow, when the Azure App is released, and backed by great team, I can move to the next challenge.\nMachine learning is becoming part of every aspect of our lives. Over last few years, ML crossed a threshold necessary to be extremely useful. I always wanted to be part of it. I took a great Coursera class by Andrew Ng, I started overnight project StockEstimator and I got involved in SeeingAI to learn how Real-World Machine Learning looks like.\nNow, I&#39;m taking it to the next level. I am joining Azure Search Team to lead their User Experience. I will be responsible for bringing the product to customers. While using my existing web development knowledge, I will have an amazing opportunity to learn more about Big Data, AI and ML.\nAzure Search is managed cloud search service that offers scalable full-text search over multiple languages, geo-spatial search, filtering and faceted navigation, type-ahead queries, hit highlighting, and custom analyzers. You can find more details in this talk by Pablo Castro (Azure Search manager and creator of Open Data Protocol).\nThe cool thing about working for Microsoft is that you may end up working with person who created HTTP protocol. Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, former Tim Berners-Lee&#39;s student, who shared office with Håkon Wium Lie (creator of CSS), joined my new team this month. What&#39;s even cooler, he is sitting next to me :)\nIn my new office with Henrik:\n\nIf you want to learn more about all the cool stuff we are doing at Cloud AI group there is an awesome .NET Rocks Podcast with Joseph Sirosh. Check it out!\n\nThere is also awesome talk by Joseph from the last Connect(); conference, which includes JFK files demo presented by Corom Thompson from my team (creator of How-Old.NET). In that demo Corom showcases how you can use Azure Search and Cognitive Services to explore JFK files. Super cool! You can see demo in below video, and code on github.\n\nIt has never been a better time to work on the intersection of Cloud and Artificial Intelligence!\n"

    "content"  : "One of the top Azure App users requests was to add Touch ID support for additional security. In this post I will share the details of implementing biometrics authentication for iOS and Android with Xamarin.\nThere are three aspects of biometrics auth:\n1. Enable user to turn biometrics authentication on and off. Users shouldn&#39;t be forced to use this additional security feature.\n2. Detecting when user should be asked for biometrics authentication, e.g., when app is coming from background, and when app is starting.\n3. Authentication process. Includes detecting hardware capabilities (is touch or face id available?), and local setup (does user configured local authentication in system settings).\nEnabling biometrics authentication usually can be controlled in settings (like in Outlook or OneDrive). We did the same in Azure App:\n\niOS\nDetecting when user is switching back to our app in iOS is pretty simple. Every time when user switch from background, method WillEnterForeground in AppDelegate is being called. We just need to override it with our custom implementation:\n\npublic override void WillEnterForeground(UIApplication application)\n{\n    // biometrics authentication logic here\n\n}\n\nYou should also authenticate user when app is being launched. In that case authentication should be performed in your initial view controller.\nIn iOS we have 2 kinds of biometrics authentication:\n1. Touch ID\n2. Face ID (available from iPhoneX)\nWe can also fallback to passcode if touch/face ID is not configured, or user&#39;s device does not support it.\nThe iOS Local Auth API is pretty straightforward, and well documented. I created simple helper to handle feature detection and authentication:\n\npublic static class LocalAuthHelper\n{\n    private enum LocalAuthType\n    {\n        None,\n        Passcode,\n        TouchId,\n        FaceId\n    }\n\n    public static string GetLocalAuthLabelText()\n    {\n        var localAuthType = GetLocalAuthType();\n\n        switch (localAuthType)\n        {\n            case LocalAuthType.Passcode:\n                return Strings.RequirePasscode;\n            case LocalAuthType.TouchId:\n                return Strings.RequireTouchID;\n            case LocalAuthType.FaceId:\n                return Strings.RequireFaceID;\n            default:\n                return string.Empty;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static string GetLocalAuthIcon()\n    {\n        var localAuthType = GetLocalAuthType();\n\n        switch (localAuthType)\n        {\n            case LocalAuthType.Passcode:\n                return SvgLibrary.LockIcon;\n            case LocalAuthType.TouchId:\n                return SvgLibrary.TouchIdIcon;\n            case LocalAuthType.FaceId:\n                return SvgLibrary.FaceIdIcon;\n            default:\n                return string.Empty;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static string GetLocalAuthUnlockText()\n    {\n        var localAuthType = GetLocalAuthType();\n\n        switch (localAuthType)\n        {\n            case LocalAuthType.Passcode:\n                return Strings.UnlockWithPasscode;\n            case LocalAuthType.TouchId:\n                return Strings.UnlockWithTouchID;\n            case LocalAuthType.FaceId:\n                return Strings.UnlockWithFaceID;\n            default:\n                return string.Empty;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static bool IsLocalAuthAvailable =&amp;gt; GetLocalAuthType() != LocalAuthType.None;\n\n    public static void Authenticate(Action onSuccess, Action onFailure)\n    {\n        var context = new LAContext();\n        NSError AuthError;\n\n        if (context.CanEvaluatePolicy(LAPolicy.DeviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics, out AuthError)\n            || context.CanEvaluatePolicy(LAPolicy.DeviceOwnerAuthentication, out AuthError))\n        {\n            var replyHandler = new LAContextReplyHandler((success, error) =&amp;gt;\n            {\n                if (success)\n                {\n                    onSuccess?.Invoke();\n                }\n                else\n                {\n                    onFailure?.Invoke();\n                }\n            });\n\n            context.EvaluatePolicy(LAPolicy.DeviceOwnerAuthentication, Strings.PleaseAuthenticateToProceed, replyHandler);\n        }\n    }\n\n    private static LocalAuthType GetLocalAuthType()\n    {\n        var localAuthContext = new LAContext();\n        NSError AuthError;\n\n        if (localAuthContext.CanEvaluatePolicy(LAPolicy.DeviceOwnerAuthentication, out AuthError))\n        {\n            if (localAuthContext.CanEvaluatePolicy(LAPolicy.DeviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics, out AuthError))\n            {\n                if (GetOsMajorVersion() &amp;gt;= 11 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; localAuthContext.BiometryType == LABiometryType.TypeFaceId)\n                {\n                    return LocalAuthType.FaceId;\n                }\n\n                return LocalAuthType.TouchId;\n            }\n\n            return LocalAuthType.Passcode;\n        }\n\n        return LocalAuthType.None;\n    }\n\n    private static int GetOsMajorVersion()\n    {\n        return int.Parse(UIDevice.CurrentDevice.SystemVersion.Split(&#39;.&#39;)[0]);\n    }\n}\n\nThere are helper methods determining proper label (GetLocalAuthLabelText), icon (GetLocalAuthIcon) and authentication text (GetLocalAuthUnlockText) depending on available authentication type. There is also one liner IsLocalAuthAvailable checking if Local Authentication (face/touch ID or passcode) is available, and Authenticate method that performs authentication, which takes success and failure callbacks as parameters. It can be used in WillEnterForeground method as follows:\n\npublic override void WillEnterForeground(UIApplication application)\n{\n    if (!AppSettings.IsLocalAuthEnabled)\n    {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    LocalAuthHelper.Authenticate(null, // do not do anything on success\n\n    () =&amp;gt;\n    {\n        // show View Controller that requires authentication\n\n        InvokeOnMainThread(() =&amp;gt;\n        {\n            var localAuthViewController = new LocalAuthViewController();\n            Window.RootViewController.ShowViewController(localAuthViewController, null);\n        });\n    });\n}\n\nWe do not have to do anything on success. The popup shown by iOS will disappear and user will be able to use the app. On failed authentication though we should display some kind of shild (e.g., ViewController) that prevent user from using the app until authorization succeed. This is how it looks in Azure App:\n\nAndroid\nDetecting when app is coming from background in Android is tricky. There is no single method that is invoked only when app is coming back from background. The OnResume method is being called when app is coming back from the background, but it&#39;s also called when you switch from one activity to another. Solution for that is to keep a time stamp with last successful authentication, and update it to DateTime.Now every time when activity is calling OnPause. This happen when app is going to background, but also when app is changing between activities. Thus we cannot simply set flag Background=true when OnPause is called. However, when difference between subsequent OnPause and OnResume is larger than some period of time (e.g., more than a few seconds) we can assume that app went to background. Below code should be implemented in some BaseActivity class that all activities inherit from:\n\npublic class BaseActivity\n{\n  public const int FingerprintAuthTimeoutSeconds = 5;\n  public static DateTime LastSuccessfulFingerprintAuth = DateTime.MinValue;\n    \n  protected override void OnResume()\n  {\n    base.OnResume();\n\n    if (IsFingerprintAvailable() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; LastSuccessfulFingerprintAuth &amp;gt; DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(-FingerprintAuthTimeoutSeconds))\n    {\n      StartActivity(typeof(FingerprintAuthActivity));\n    }\n  }\n\n  protected override void OnPause()\n  {\n    base.OnPause();\n\n    if (IsFingerprintAvailable())\n    {\n      LastSuccessfulFingerprintAuth = DateTime.Now;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThe basics of Fingerprint authentication are very well described in Xamarin docs.\nEven better reference is a sample app FingerprintGuide from Xamarin.\nThe main disadvantage of adding fingerprint authentication in Android (over Face/Touch ID in iOS) is requirement to build your own UI and logic for the authentication popup. This includes adding icon, and handling all authentication results. iOS handles incorrect scan, and displays popup again with passcode fallback after too many unsuccessful tries. In Android you have to implement this entire logic by yourself.\nSummary\nAdding biometrics authentication is useful for apps that hold sensitive data, like banking apps, file managers (Dropbox, OneDrive), or an app that has access to your Azure Resources :)\nImplementing local authentication in iOS is pretty straightforward, and iOS APIs provide authentication UI for free. In Android however, the APIs are only working with the backend, and UI has to be implemented by you.\nLocal authentication should be always optional. Some users may not need nor want it. Thus, it should be configurable in the app settings.\nTry out biometrics auth in Azure App!\n\n\n"

To remove account you need to simply sign out.\nLimitations\nFirst limitation (AKA caveat): when you are adding second live account you, you may run into the following screen during authentication with Active Directory:\n\nThis is Active Directory limitation. Just tap &#39;Sign out and sign in with a different account&#39;, and we will sign you in to another account without signing you out from another.\nSecond limitation: you are not able to sign in into two accounts if they are associated with one email. Yes! One email can be used to sign in to more than 1 account. If you are seeing screen similar like below during authentication this is a case:\n\nIn this situation you need to sign out, and then sign in again choosing another account.\nSummary\nI personally love this feature as switching between my MSDN account and work account was a pain in the past.

We had to find another way.\nCaching libraries for Xamarin\nWe looked at a few libraries for caching (e.g., MemoryCache and Akavache), but surprisingly none of them manage cache size and memory. They simply add items to Dictionary, and if you add too many you get OutOfMemoryException.\nIt may not be an issue for many applications, but in Azure App we need to take into account users who has multiple subscriptions with thousands of resources.\nBTW: Akavache is a great library. Besides in-memory cache it also supports persistent cache, have clean APIs and a lot of great documentation.\nImplementing in-memory cache\nAfter browsing internets and asking people at Xamarin chat we didn&#39;t find anything that would work for us, and we decided to implement in-memory cache by ourselves.\n\npublic class InMemoryCache&amp;lt;t&amp;gt; : IInMemoryCache&amp;lt;t&amp;gt;\n{\n    private const int LimitedCacheThreshold = 1000;\n\n    private class Reference\n    {\n        private int _hitCount = 0;\n\n        public DateTimeOffset Timestamp\n        {\n            get;\n            private set;\n        }\n\n        public T Data\n        {\n            get;\n            private set;\n        }\n\n        public void AddRef()\n        {\n            Interlocked.Increment(ref _hitCount);\n        }\n\n        public int ResetRef()\n        {\n            var count = _hitCount;\n            _hitCount = 0;\n            return count;\n        }\n\n        public static Reference Create(T obj)\n        {\n            return new Reference()\n            {\n                Timestamp = DateTimeOffset.Now,\n                Data = obj,\n            };\n        }\n\n        private Reference()\n        {\n        }\n    }\n\n    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary&amp;lt;string, WeakReference&amp;lt;reference&amp;gt;&amp;gt; _weakCache;\n    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary&amp;lt;string, Reference&amp;gt; _limitedCache;\n    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary&amp;lt;string, Task&amp;lt;t&amp;gt;&amp;gt; _pendingTasks;\n\n    private InMemoryCache()\n    {\n        _weakCache = new ConcurrentDictionary&amp;lt;string, WeakReference&amp;lt;reference&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(StringComparer.Ordinal);\n        _limitedCache = new ConcurrentDictionary&amp;lt;string, Reference&amp;gt;(StringComparer.Ordinal);\n        _pendingTasks = new ConcurrentDictionary&amp;lt;string, Task&amp;lt;t&amp;gt;&amp;gt;(StringComparer.Ordinal);\n    }\n\n    public static IInMemoryCache&amp;lt;t&amp;gt; Create()\n    {\n        return new InMemoryCache&amp;lt;t&amp;gt;();\n    }\n\n    public async Task&amp;lt;t&amp;gt; GetOrAdd(string key, DateTimeOffset expiration, Func&amp;lt;string, Task&amp;lt;t&amp;gt;&amp;gt; addFactory)\n    {\n        WeakReference&amp;lt;reference&amp;gt; cachedReference;\n\n        if (_weakCache.TryGetValue(key, out cachedReference))\n        {\n            Reference cachedValue;\n            if (cachedReference.TryGetTarget(out cachedValue) || cachedValue != null)\n            {\n                if (cachedValue.Timestamp &amp;gt; expiration)\n                {\n                    cachedValue.AddRef();\n                    return cachedValue.Data;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        try\n        {\n            var actualValue = await _pendingTasks.GetOrAdd(key, addFactory);\n\n            if (_limitedCache.Count &amp;gt; LimitedCacheThreshold)\n            {\n                var keysToRemove = _limitedCache\n                    .Select(item =&amp;gt; Tuple.Create(\n                        item.Value.ResetRef(),\n                        item.Value.Timestamp,\n                        item.Key))\n                    .ToArray()\n                    .OrderBy(item =&amp;gt; item.Item1)\n                    .ThenBy(item =&amp;gt; item.Item2)\n                    .Select(item =&amp;gt; item.Item3)\n                    .Take(LimitedCacheThreshold / 2)\n                    .ToArray();\n\n                foreach (var k in keysToRemove)\n                {\n                    Reference unused;\n                    _limitedCache.TryRemove(k, out unused);\n                }\n            }\n\n            var reference = Reference.Create(actualValue);\n            _weakCache[key] = new WeakReference&amp;lt;reference&amp;gt;(reference);\n            _limitedCache[key] = reference;\n\n            return actualValue;\n        }\n        finally\n        {\n            Task&amp;lt;t&amp;gt; unused;\n            _pendingTasks.TryRemove(key, out unused);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWe use two layers of caching. First is using WeakReference that leaves memory management to Garbage Collector. As GC is not very predictable and sometimes may unnecessary release some reference, we have second layer of caching. We call it _limitedCache, and it keeps objects in memory until capacity reach 1000 objects. Then we remove half (500), least used objects from dictionary. Because the same objects are being kept in two dictionaries, the WeakReference will never be released as long as object is in _limitedCache. Thus, we always check only if object is present in _weakCache.\nThere is also third dictionary that keeps track of pending tasks that are responsible for getting data. This prevents us from sending the same requests more than once if object is not in cache yet.\nSummary\nWhat is great about building apps with Xamarin is the ability to share code across platforms. When we were implementing cache, we didn&#39;t touch any platform specific code. All work was done in Portable Class Library.\nAdding cache to Azure App helped not only to decrease user&#39;s network data usage, but also to improve performance significantly!\nIf you need in-memory cache for your app, go ahead and use the above code snippet! If you are looking for persistent cache then consider using Akavache.\nAre you caching? How? Why? Why not?\n"

    "content"  : "The latest Azure Mobile App update has statuses on the resources list:\n\nYou probably want to ask why we didn&#39;t have them before. Great question! Currently Azure Resource Manager (public API we are using to get your Azure resources) requires to make separate calls to get single resource status. It means: if you have 100-200 resources, you would have to make 100-200 extra calls. There are some people who has almost 2000 in one subscription! Taking performance and data usage into consideration, this is not ideal.\nBoth iOS and Android platforms allows to address this problem to some extent by querying for status only resources that are currently visible. However this is still extra 5-10 calls. It is even worse when you start scrolling, and very bad if you scroll on your list containing 2000 resources.\nBatch API\nSometime ago ARM added Batch API - you can send POST request with up to 20 URIs in the body. Response will contain up to 20 packaged responses that you have to extract. Using batch API, you can decrease number of requests by up to 20x. This matters especially when user has a lot of resources and keep scrolling on the list.\nWhen implementing batch requests, you need to figure out the optimal interval for sending requests. We started with 200ms, but then we changed it to 50ms. Additionally, every time new request is coming we delay sending batch request by additional 50ms. This may cause indefinite delay. In order to solve this: we always submit request if queue has 20 or more pending requests. 20*50ms = 1000ms = 1s = long time! We tweaked it again, and changed interval to 20ms. With current implementation, we wait anytime between 20ms and 400ms to send batch request.\nImplementing Batch API\nYou probably gonna say: &quot;it all sounds great, but how do I implement it&quot;? For you convenience I created small console application that demonstrate ARM Batch API in action, and I put it on github.\nXamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android does not have System.Threading.Timer. We created our own implementation OneShotTimer (thanks William Moy!).\nEntire magic happens in ArmService. It has one public method GetResource that instead of directly sending GET request is adding request to ConcurrentQueue. OneShotTimer and BatchRequestDipatcher methods are responsible for sending the actual HTTP request.\nIn order to run console app, you need to provide ARM token, and (optionally) resource ids you want to request. In demo app I provided fake resource ids, which will be fine to issue requests, but you will not get resource back.\nTo get ARM token, go to Azure Portal, open F12 tools and inspect some ARM request. From request headers, copy Authorization header (string starting with Bearer rAnDoMcHaRacTErS...):\n\nYou can also get resources ids from F12 tab. The best way is to go to All Resources blade, and find some batch request:\n\nOnce you paste resource ids and ArmToken in Program.cs you can run the app, and you should see the following output:\n\nRequests are send in random time, anytime from 0 to 5s after program runs. This is done using Task.Delay:\n\nvar tasks = _resourceIds.Select(async resourceId =&amp;gt;\n{\n  await Task.Delay(new Random().Next() % 5000);   // simulate calling GetResource from different parts of UI\n  var response = await _armService.GetResource(resourceId);\n  resources.Add(response);\n});\n\nWhen you change randomness from 5s to 0.5s you can observe that there will be less batch requests (AKA more requests sent in single batch):\n\nSummary\nUsing Batch API for getting resource statuses visibly improves performance in the mobile app. It is noticeable especially when using network data.\nAzure Resource Manager has plans to add ARM API that will allow to do 1 request to get multiple resources with statuses. This should improve performance even more in the future.\nIf you are facing similar problem with your app, consider implementing Batch API on your server!\n"

    "content"  : "\n\n\n\nFor last 6 months I&#39;ve been working on the Azure Mobile App for iOS and Android. We officially announced it at Microsoft&#39;s //build conference keynote last month.\n\nNow, you can monitor your Azure Resources from your phone! You can also take quick management actions, like start/stop/restart. Actually, you can do whatever you want using Cloud Shell that enables you to execute any command available through Azure CLI and PowerShell.\nTo learn more about the app functionalities, check out Michael Flanakin&#39;s blog post: Introducing the Azure app public preview.\nXamarin\nThe app is built with Xamarin Native in C#. To learn more about Xamarin, checkout my blog post Getting started with Xamarin in 2016.\nThe great thing about Xamarin Native apps is the fact that you can do everything what is possible when building native iOS apps with swift and native Android apps with Java. You can take any code sample in swift or Java, translate it to C# and use in your Xamarin app. Additionally, you can share code across platforms. We have around 60-70% code share. Most of our code is shared using PCL (Portable Class Library). Some components are in Shared Project.\n\nContinuous Integration and Continuous Delivery with VSTS and Hockey App\nVSTS provide awesome tools for customizing build params, running tests, and deploying with HockeyApp. What&#39;s more, when you are publishing your alpha/beta builds with HockeyApp you get auto-update notifications for free.\nWe have 3 environments:\n\nalpha - deployed on every commit if tests are passing (used by team members)\nbeta - deployed after merge from alpha branch if all tests are passing (available for all Microsoft employees - it allows us to test the next release candidate)\nApp Store / Google Play - deployed manually (Apple does not provide mechanism to auto-deploy and we are working on automating Google Play deploy from VSTS)\n\nBuild definitions\nI blogged about setting up VSTS for Xamarin.iOS earlier this year. Configuring Android build is much easier. Our VSTS build pipelines for iOS and Android look like below.\n\n\nThe general scenario is:\n\nbuild in Debug mode (in order to initialize TestCloud, which I described in this blog post)\nrun tests\nbuild in Release mode (without TestCloud init code)\ndeploy to HockeyApp\n\nWe are thinking about running tests in Release mode (it requires passing TEST_CLOUD build param to build command explicitly). This will give us the same app that later on will be deployed to HockeyApp. A few times we had situations when app was working fine in Debug mode and all UI tests were passing, but it was crashing on startup in Release mode. In this case, if somebody updated app on their device, they had to uninstall it, and install manually again after we fixed bug causing crash. Very inconvenient.\nStoring secrets\nVSTS provides mechanism to keep your secrets (passwords and tokens) outside of your source code. You can store them in Variables tab in your build definition. Notice small lock next to secret value. Once you click it, it will hide the secret forever. There is no way to read it back from VSTS. I&#39;ve done this a few times, and had to regenerate keys and tokens. You can store your secrets in Azure KeyVault, where they are always readable.\n\nWhen you are running UI tests, usually you need to authenticate (AKA you need password to login with your test account). There is no way to pass password as parameter to Test Cloud, but there is a workaround: we have file Password.txt in UI test project (without password of course), and before running UI tests, we run shell script that takes password (from VSTS Variables) as parameter and writes it to the Password.txt file. You can pass variables stored in VSTS as arguments to VSTS tasks.\nThis is shell script:\n\n#!/bin/bash\necho $1 &amp;gt; $2/Tests/AzureMobile.UITests/password.txt\n\nAnd this is VSTS task:\n\nVSTS is awesome! It allows you to do almost anything with VSTS tasks or custom scripts. You can modify version number in Info.plist file before building solution, add release notes from git commit messages and much, much more.\nUI tests with Xamarin Test Cloud\nTestCloud is awesome. It allows you not only automate UI testing. It also enables you to test your app on hundreds of devices without need of buying any of them.\nUI tests are usually the longest running task in our build pipeline. In order to minimize wait times between builds, we run UI tests only on one, most reliable device. We have separate build definitions to run UI tests nightly on 20 iOS and 40 Android devices. It takes longer, but it helps us to identify issues related to particular device model. Most of the time we don&#39;t have changes that are breaking single device.\nWe are also thinking about creating 1-2 smoke tests that will be run on every commit, and run entire suite nightly or on separate build (to don&#39;t block other runs).\nDon&#39;t assert! Use WaitFor!\nUI testing 101: when you are writing UI tests, remember to wait for UI to update before asserting some condition. E.g., let&#39;s say you have button and label. After button click, you expect label to update its text to &#39;Button clicked&#39;. Below test will be very flakey:\n\napp.Tap(&quot;myButton&quot;);\nAssert.AreEqual(&quot;Button clicked&quot;, app.Query(&quot;myLabel&quot;).Label);\n\nLabel may not get updated before assertion gets executed. Instead you should use WaitFor:\n\napp.Tap(&quot;myButton&quot;);\napp.WaitFor(app.Query(&quot;myLabel&quot;).Label.Equals(&quot;Button clicked&quot;, StringComparison.InvariantCulture));\n\nPage Object Pattern\nAnother very good practice for writing UI tests is to use Page Object Pattern. This allows you to isolate implementation details from tests scenarios.\nHere is one of our tests:\n\n[Test]\npublic void Favorites_AddToFavorites_ResourceVisibleOnFavoritesPage()\n{\n    // Arrange\n    var resourceToFavorite = TestResources.Azurembwinvm;\n    TapTabBarItem(Strings.Resources);\n\n    // Act\n    _resourcesPage.TapResourceByName(resourceToFavorite);\n    _resourceDetailsPage.VerifyPresent();\n    _resourceDetailsPage.ExecuteCommand(Strings.Favorite, Strings.Unfavorite);\n    _resourceDetailsPage.GoBack();\n\n    // Assert\n    TapTabBarItem(Strings.Favorites);\n    _favoritesPage.VerifyPresent();\n    _favoritesPage.VerifyNavBarTitle(1);\n    _favoritesPage.WaitForResourceByName(resourceToFavorite);\n}\n\nHere, are some methods implemented in Page class:\n\npublic FavoritesPage WaitForResourceByName(string resourceName)\n{\n    _app.Screenshot($&quot;Waiting for resource {resourceName}...&quot;);\n\n    _app.WaitForElement(resourceName);\n\n    return this;\n}\n\npublic FavoritesPage TapResourceByName(string resourceName)\n{\n    _app.Screenshot($&quot;Tapping resource &#39;{resourceName}&#39;...&quot;);\n\n    _app.WaitForAndTapOnElement(resourceName);\n\n    return this;\n}\n\npublic FavoritesPage WaitForNoResourceByName(string resourceName)\n{\n    _app.Screenshot($&quot;Checking if resource &#39;{resourceName}&#39; is not present...&quot;);\n\n    _app.WaitForNoElement(resourceName);\n\n    return this;\n}\n\nScreenshots during UI tests\nAs you probably noticed in above code snippet, we are taking screenshots at almost every step. Thanks to Page Object Pattern we don&#39;t have to think about it in our test steps, but only in our Page implementations. Screenshots helps a lot in diagnosing failures in TestCloud:\n\nAbove test is failing when Waiting for DetailsCommandLayout... Thanks to screenshot, you can easily identify the line of code responsible for failure.\nMonitoring and Crash Reporting with HockeyApp and AppInsights\nA lot of people are using HockeyApp for crash reporting. Not many people are using it for application logging though. That&#39;s because HockeyApp does not provide a good way for searching logs. However, you can create an AppInsights bridge app and stream all HockeyApp events to AppInsights.\nAppInsights provides very powerful query explorer to search through your logs.\nBy default logs are preserved for 3 months, but you can export them to storage account and keep forever if you want.\nWhat&#39;s more, you can create awesome PowerBI dashboards using data from AppInsights.\nXamarin Open Source plugins and libraries\nWe saved a lot of time by using cross-platform Xamarin plugins:\n\nXamSettings Plugin (from James Montemagno) - it is an abstraction over native data storage (SharedPreferences for Android, NSUserDefaults for iOS) that allows you to store/access local data in shared code\nFFImageLoading (from Daniel Luberda) - very powerful image library, it allows us to convert SVGs to native formats in runtime, in shared code\nOxyPlot (recommended by Frank Kruger) - awesome, powerful, cross-platform chart library used for metrics visualization\n\nXamarin community is awesome. If you are building Xamarin apps, I strongly recommend you to join slack channel XamarinChat. You can find there a lot of great developers who are willing to help. We learned about FFImageLoading there. What&#39;s more, Daniel Luberda (FFImageLoading top contributor) is very active there. One time, he fixed a bug in less than 6h after reporting it by us :)\nSummary\nI am really excited about this app. It is an awesome feeling to take an app from zero to //build keynote. I am even more excited because there is a lot more to come. You can help us with that! If you have an idea about what should be added/changed/removed in Azure App go to aka.ms/azureapp/feedback and add or vote for a feature.\nIn meantime, get the app from App Store or Google Play, and let us know what you think!\n\n\nCheck out me and James Montemagno chatting about the app on Xamarin Show:\n\n\n\n*This post was written in the clouds during my flight from Seattle to Frankfurt :)\n"

    "content"  : "\nYou are probably familiar with Uncle Bob&#39;s classic: Clean Code. While Clean Code is about good engineering practices, and writing good code, The Clean Coder is more about communication aspect of developer&#39;s work. It&#39;s about how to behave professionally, be disciplined, and stick to good coding practices. What&#39;s more, it demonstrates how to avoid common pitfalls in software development process. Such as underestimating time, undergo management pressure or cutting corners (AKA writing bad code).\nIn Clean Coder, Uncle Bob is explaining by example how to communicate at work. Don&#39;t try to be just a &quot;nice guy&quot;. Be professional and responsible, while being polite. There is nothing worse than giving false promises just to make others happy. However, I have an impression that a lot of people are able to get away with that.\nDoes below sounds familiar to you?\n\nDo you remember a situation when you thought: &quot;Damn, I wish I didn&#39;t add this test. I would save a day&quot;? What about situation like: &quot;Damn, I wish I did add that test. It would cost me 1 day, but I would save 2 days I spent fixing the bug this test would guard against&quot;? I&#39;ll let you to deal with the answer.\nIf you don&#39;t want to read entire book, read first 3 chapters. It is a great summary and advice on common wrong doing of most programmers that is not caused by their lack of proficiency, but rather not sticking to their professionalism and discipline.\nOhh...and if you have never heard about Uncle Bob checkout Every Uncle Bob Robert C Martin Video playlist on youtube, his blog, and SOLID principles. Uncle Bob is like your doctor who is telling you that you should eat healthy and exercise regularly. He has similar advises, but about how you should write code.\nThe Clean Coder is definitely one of the best books I&#39;ve read about Software Development, and I&#39;m adding it to my favorites.\nAre you developer? What are your thoughts? Does some situations described in this book happened for you? Maybe you are business person? What do you think? Leave a comment!\n"

    "content"  : "\nOver four years ago I created a simple Pomidoro Windows App in order to learn Windows RT app development. Yeah! Windows RT was a new thing back then! My app was a simple timer that counts down from 25 minutes to 0. It was designed to use when applying the Pomodoro Technique. I published it to Windows Store as a free app. Since then me and a few friends of mine were using it. It made it to top 600 productivity apps on Win Store.\nThe main purpose of creating this app was to get insight into Windows RT apps development, and experience publishing app to Windows Store.\nLast year, somebody from Pomodoro Technique filed Content Infringement Complaint stating that\nApp name has a name including &quot;Pomodoro Technique®&quot; and &quot;Pomodoro®&quot; or significative parts or misspelling of Pomodoro and Pomodoro Technique\nWhat that means? My app, created over the weekend, is serious competition for their app. What&#39;s more, they removed my app from Windows Store!\n\nRecently, my friend Pawel Sawicz - who co-founded dotNetConfPL with me - asked me about this app. He was using it from day to day, but he got a new ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 3, and he had to install a new system. When he wanted to install my Pomidoro app from the Windows Store he couldn&#39;t find it. He thought that the search was broken. Then he reached out to me, and I explained him the situation.

    "content"  : "\nEveryday when I am doing some small bug fixes or minor improvements I am thinking about the British Cycling team. They dominated 2012 Olympics thanks to marginal improvements. Such as cleaning hands properly, taking their own pillows when traveling or sleeping in the right position. All of these small things put together resulted in 7 out of 10 track cycling gold medals.\nIt turns out that the same strategy might work in software development. Especially if you work on large project.\n1 million dollar improvement\nIn Azure Portal we have hundreds of developers working on one codebase. We are using MSBuild to perform builds. With default options, MSBuild was printing out to console a lot of logs that weren&#39;t very useful. When you are building project, you are usually interested in errors. It turned out that changing verbosity of output speed up builds from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the project that is being built and type of the build (incremental / rebuild all).\nTaking into account that there is at least 100 developers working everyday on the Azure Portal (in fact there is much more, but not everybody is working on the Portal full time), and assuming that everybody is performing at least 20 builds per day (savings up to 30 seconds per build), and 4-5 full project builds (savings around 1-2 minutes), every developer can save around 20 minutes everyday!\nThis gives us:\n100 developers x 20 minutes x 240 days working days per year = 480,000 minutes = 8,000 hours\nAssuming ~$150/hr  it give us total savings: 8000*$150 = $1,200,000\nIncremental changes over years\nWhen I am looking back, I am impressed how much the Azure Portal have changed over last two years. This is portal in 2014:\n\nThis is portal in 2017:\n\nWe haven&#39;t done any breakthrough changes overnight. I have never had a feeling that one day resulted in some significant difference. It was 1 step at the time, one small bug fix one day, one tiny part of new feature another day.\nSmall improvements every day, everywhere...\nThis applies not only to large scale project. Think about Open Source. Even when you are doing documentation improvements for ASP.NET docs, you can save time for hundreds of developers. You are not saving particular company&#39;s money, but you are saving our (developers) money and what&#39;s even more important, time that can be invested somewhere else.\nAnother great example of small incremental improvements is John-David Dalton. Creator of lodash. He is contributing code on github every(!) day for a few years now. This is his github contributions chart:\n\nNo white squares. Some of his daily commits are tiny, some are small. By being consistent every day, over years he was able to create one of the most popular JavaScript library.\nWhat small improvement can you do in your project? Think about it, and remember that best ideas are born when you are away from your computer!\n"

If you are working on some overnight idea this is a must read! Why? In all cases it will help you to plan features, use data-driven approach for making decisions, and avoid waisting time by doing work that is not needed.\nEric Ries describes - on example of his own startup - how his team wasted weeks and months of development work, by working on features that turned out to be not needed nor wanted by customers. To avoid such pitfall, he is proposing different approach: create simplest possible prototype, release it and wait for users&#39; feedback.\nLean startup is not only for startups. It is for everyone working on some product. From 1 person to international corporation. Eric gives great advice on how to evolve products and how to maximize your ROI (Return of Investment). He emphasize the importance of ability to reacting to feedback fast, not focusing too much on vanity metrics, but focusing on long term vision instead.\nThis book goes to my favorite books list!\nIf you haven&#39;t read it yet, I strongly encourage you to do so.

    "content"  : "Visual Studio Team Services has great Continuous Integration and Continues Delivery support for Xamarin.\nRecently I was configuring pipeline that would build the project, run unit tests (with xUnit), run UI tests (with Xamarin Test Cloud), and, if all tests pass, deploy new version of the app to Hockey App. During the process of creating VSTS build definition I encountered a few problems that I think are worth to share with you.\nTo make a basic build definition with building Xamarin.iOS project and deploying to Hockey App with VSTS+Xamarin check James Montemagno&#39;s Continuous Integration for iOS Apps with Visual Studio Team Services first.\nThe issues I had, that were not described anywhere online:\n\nI couldn&#39;t use &quot;Visual Studio Test&quot; task for running xUnit tests, because every build definition on VSTS can be executed by only one build agent, and to build Xamarin project I needed Mac build agent.\nHow to run UI tests (with Xamarin Test Cloud) using the same build that would be later on deployed to Hockey App? Test Cloud requires init code that later on shouldn&#39;t be present in deployed app.\n\nRunning xUnit tests with Mac build agent\nThis requires adding 2 tasks to build definition:\n\nCommand Line task - to run tests with mono and xUnit console runner.\nPublish Test Results task - to display results in build summary\n\nFirst, install xUnit console runner NuGet package.\nTo run tests, add command line task with following settings:\n\nTool: mono\nArguments: packages/xunit.runner.console.2.1.0/tools/xunit.console.exe YourApp.UnitTests/bin/Debug/YourApp.UnitTests.dll -xml UnitTestsResults.xml\n\nRemember to replace YourApp with your app name, and set the same xUnit runner version that you have installed.\nTo publish test results, add &quot;Publish Test Results&quot; task with the following settings:\n\nTest Result Format: XUnit\nTest Result Files: **/UnitTestsResults.xml\nAlways run: true\n\nRunning Xamarin UI tests with Test Cloud before deploying to HockeyApp\nThe solution there is rather simple: build in Debug mode that has TEST_CLOUD preprocessor directive defined, run tests, and then build again in Release mode before deploying to Hockey App.\nDelete files before build\nFor a while I couldn&#39;t figure out why my tests are not passing when run from VSTS while they pass on my machine. It turned out, VSTS was using old builds for tests. I am not sure about MacInCloud, but if you are using your own Build Agent running on your Mac the directories that contains binary files are not being cleaned up before next build automatically. To avoid using old builds, you can add, at the beginning of your pipeline, &quot;Delete Files&quot; task and delete everything from bin/* and obj/*.\nSummary\nThe final build definition looks like that:\n\nLet me know if I missed some details! I would be happy to add them! Also - if you know better way of doing that - let me know as well!\n"

In Shanghai I met Jaime Levy (famous UX strategist from LA), Kinshuk Mishra (Director of Engineering at Spotify), Pete Soderling (successful entrepreneur from New York and Silicon Valley, founder of Hakka Labs &amp;amp; DataEngConf), Sid Anand (former Cloud Data Architect at Netflix who implemented Netflix migration to the cloud that Adrian Cockcroft later on told the World about, former Tech Lead at LinkedIn where he implemented typeahead search, currently Data Architect at Agari - company that provides fraud detection services), Wesley Reisz (Solutions Architect at HP and University Professor), and Igor Marvić (Software Engineer at Spotify).\nChina is very interesting place for developers, especially because of its scale. They have over 700 million Internet users! One developer from alibaba.com - largest online store in China - told me that during Singles&#39; Day (Guanggun Jie), which is equivalent of Black Friday in USA, they had over 400 million customers online at the same time. This is more than entire population of the United States (~325 million). They also sold more than $1 billion in merchandise in first 8 minutes! This is SCALE!\nWhile I was in China I was using WeChat (their Facebook equivalent). People don&#39;t use Facebook and twitter, as they are blocked by China Firewall. You can workaround it using VPN, but sometimes it works very slow, or not at all. Thus, it is much easier to just use WeChat. When I am in USA I use Facebook, messenger and twitter everyday. However, I noticed that on my iPhone 5S, WeChat works much better than all mentioned apps. It doesn&#39;t crash, it&#39;s fast, and it has many cool features. Want to add somebody to friends? Just scan they QRCode. You can also shake your phone, and WeChat will try to find closest person who is also shaking their phone, and show on your phone their profile, and on their phone your profile.\nBesides the conference, which was very well organized, I was very impressed by how modern the city of Shanghai is. The skyline looks almost like New York City! Shanghai Tower (2,073 ft / 632 m) is the second tallest building in the World. Shanghai World Financial Center (1,614 ft / 492 m) is number 9 on the same list, which contains only 1 American building - One World Trade Center (number 6 - 1,776 ft / 541 m).\n\nIt was a great journey, and all Chinese people were very nice for me. I look forward to come back to China in near future!\n"

This approach can be used to test components of your website.\nYou can take your accessibility testing to the next level by adding accessibility check for entire pages.\nDo you remember Martin Fowler&#39;s testing pyramid?\n\nWhile high-level UI tests can detect the same issues that unit tests can, usually UI tests are slower to run. Sometimes it takes 30 seconds to 1 minute to run 1 UI test, while unit test can be run in less than 100 milliseconds. Ideally you should have the most common scenario covered by UI test, and all possible customizations (on the component level) covered by unit tests. You can also add UI tests for some complex combinations of your components, and when you are fixing a bug in situation that unit test cannot cover encountered scenario. Because as you know, while fixing a bug, you should add unit test covering buggy scenario.\nIn general, unit tests and UI tests should be complementary. UI test should indicate an issue, while unit test should help you to find a source of the problem.\nIn accessibility testing, high-level checks are very useful in detecting accessibility issues caused by some &quot;small change&quot;. Once you detect accessibility violation, you should:\n\nnarrow it down to particular unit of your website\nadd unit test to cover broken scenario\nmake sure it fails\nfix the issue (by writing code)\nmake sure that unit test pass\nmake sure that end to end UI tests pass\n\nCheck out Marcy Sutton&#39;s article: Accessibility Testing with aXe and WebdriverJS. She created sample github repo that is demonstrating how to set everything up.\n"

    "content"  : "In Web Accessibility Hacker Way I mentioned that &quot;only 20% of accessibility requirements can be verified by tools&quot;. Nevertheless, it is worth to cover this 20%. Especially, when it is not very hard. You know that having automated test that guard against regressions always pays off in a long run.\nAs of today the best automatic verification tool for accessibility is aXe.\n\nThere is aXe Chrome plugin and aXe Firefox plugin that enables you to run accessibility audit manually:\n\nRunning automated tool manually is useful, but it is better to run it automatically as unit test, and incorporate it into your Continuous Integration to run it automatically after every commit.\nRunning accessibility audit with aXe\nYou can install aXe with npm:\nnpm i axe-core\nThe aXe has a function a11yCheck that performs accessibility audit on specified HTML Element. You may run it against widgets or partial views on your web app. That function takes 2 parameters:\n\nHTMLElement to be audited\ncallback function that is invoked with results parameter\n\n\naxe.a11yCheck($(&quot;#myElement&quot;)[0], function (results) {\n    expect(results.violations.length).toBe(0);\n    results.violations.length &amp;amp;&amp;amp; console.error(results.violations);\n});\n\nIt is useful to print errors to console, as the results.violations is an array of nested objects with different properties. Many of them are helpful to diagnose the issue.\n\n*a11y is abbreviation for accessibility (similar like i18n for internationalization), 11 is number of letters between &#39;a&#39; and &#39;y&#39;\nRunning aXe with Jasmine 2.x\nIn order to run aXe with Jasmine, you need to take into account that a11yCheck is asynchronous. Thus, you need to pass and invoke done function:\n\ndescribe(&quot;a11y check&quot;, function() {\n  it(&quot;has no accessbility violations (check console for errors)&quot;, function(done) {\n    axe.a11yCheck($(&quot;#myElement&quot;)[0], function (results) {\n        expect(results.violations.length).toBe(0);\n        if (results.violations.length &amp;gt; 0) {\n            console.error(results.violations);\n        }\n        done();\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nRunning aXe with QUnit 2.x\nIt is similar in QUnit. You also need to invoke done function, but first you need to get it by calling assert.async():\n\nQUnit.test(&quot;a11y check&quot;, function(assert) {\n    var done = assert.async();\n\n    axe.a11yCheck($(&quot;#myElement&quot;)[0], function (results) {\n        assert.strictEqual(results.violations.length, 0, &quot;There should be no A11y violations (check console for errors)&quot;);\n        if (results.violations.length &amp;gt; 0) {\n            console.error(results.violations);\n        }\n        done();\n    });\n});\n\nSample\nI created a sample with button and input tag:\n\n&amp;lt;div id=&quot;fixture&quot;&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;button&amp;gt;My button&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt; \n  &amp;lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; /&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n\nThis sample is not accessible because input tag does not have a label, and a11yCheck should report violations. The sample code, with Jasmine and QUnit tests, is available on github: axe-unittests.\nSummary\nWhile automated accessibility unit tests are great, you probably still want to use aXe plugin for Chrome to investigate reported violations. It&#39;s more convenient, and it has neat user interface, while in unit tests you need to dig in into console errors.\nWhen you start adding accessibility checks for different parts of your system, you may encounter many violations at first. It is better to still add tests, that ignore known violations, and then incrementally fix the issues. This approach prevents regressions, while delaying adding test until all violations are fixed may cause introducing new ones while fixing others.\n"

    "content"  : "I haven&#39;t publish any book review for a while. It does not mean I am not reading books anymore. I just didn&#39;t feel that some of the books I read recently requires my recommendation, or I didn&#39;t have any thoughts that I needed necessary to share right now.\nI have added a few books to my favorite books list though. Check them out!\nWorking Effectively with Legacy Code deserves blog post because of a few reasons:\n\nEvery Software Developer should read it\nIt&#39;s not really about legacy code\nPublished in 2004 (12 years ago!) is still very up to date\n\n\nThe book has three parts:\n\nImportance of unit tests when changing software\nRecipes for real World problems that we face when changing software (e.g., &quot;I need to change a monster method&quot; or &quot;What methods should I test when introducing a change&quot;)\nDependency-breaking techniques catalog\n\nThe first part should be familiar to most of programmers these days. If it is not for you then you should read Agile Principles, Patterns and Practices (by Robert Martin), TDD by Example (by Kent Beck), and The Art of Unit Testing (by Roy Osherove). You can thank me later.\nThe second part is the essence of the book. It shows, by example, how to add new feature, make a change to existing code, or fix a bug. Most books about software development, present examples on very simple, clean code that we never see in real World. This book, takes some messy piece of code and shows how to make it testable, how to get rid of too many side effects, and clean it up by separating dependencies and responsibilities. Many times we want to test one functionality, and then we realize that we need to instantiate tens of objects that other method depends on. Sounds familiar? This chapter shows how to handle that.\nThe last part (Dependency-Breaking Techniques) is very similar to Martin Fowler&#39;s Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code. It&#39;s a set of techniques, and step by step description how to apply them to existing code.\nAs I mentioned earlier. This book is not really about legacy code. I think it is more about evolving existing code. It is natural, when adding features, we add lines of code to the method. The hard part is to know when you should extract new method, or introduce a class, and refactor dependencies. It&#39;s OK to have global variables. The problem is to keep track of them or localize them. How do you know, that adding a new functionality will not break something? You have 100% test coverage for every possible use case? That&#39;s not possible because of complexity of software we are creating today. &quot;What methods should I test&quot; shows neat technique to backtrack effects, and side effects of a change that we are introducing.\nThere is much more, and you should check out this book. You don&#39;t have to read it from cover to cover. I strongly recommend you, at least, to scan through part 2 (changing software), and I am sure you will learn something new that you can apply for your project today!\n"

    "content"  : "\nIt feels like it was yesterday when I published My first year at Microsoft. Time is going fast! This is what usually happen when you have a lot of things to do, and you enjoy it. My second year spent at Microsoft has been great! Full of new experiences, challenges, and lessons learned.\nAzure Portal\n\nFor the past 2 years I&#39;ve been working on the Azure Portal. Last 12 months has been very important for entire Portal team. Since December 2, 2015 the new Azure Portal is no longer in preview, and is now an official management interface for Azure. The Old Portal is still available, but we slowly retire its features, and move them one by one to the new Portal. More, and more people start liking the new, revolutionary UI. We are getting requests to Open Source our UI, so that people can use it to build their own management interfaces. If you are interested in that, vote here.\nOver last year I helped to improve Portal reliability, which was our last milestone before becoming the official management portal for Azure. It was one of the hardest things I&#39;ve ever worked on, because of the Portal Architecture. We started from 80% reliability in some areas, and our goal was to achieve 99.9%. It was extensive few months of investigation, bug fixing, and optimization. Once we achieved three nines, now we have to stay there. We are getting regressions from time to time, but for most of the time we keep the reliability at the desired level.\nAnother big area was improving accessibility (keyboard + screen reader support). It was very challenging task because, again, the Azure Portal is nothing like most of web apps. Especially from the design perspective. It&#39;s totally different, non-standard, and has a bunch of features nobody have done before (blades, tiles and journeys). As of today I am amazed how much progress have been done, and what the current state of Portal accessibility is. One thing that amaze me at Microsoft is how the smallest, tiniest, everyday improvements makes a difference in a long run.\nBesides reliability and accessibility, I work mostly, on the web controls that are being exposed by our Framework. Partner teams (e.g., Web Apps, Virtual Machines, SQL, etc.) are building Azure features using our Framework and controls. Over last 12 months I created a few controls, added a lot of features to existing ones, fixed a tons of bugs, and made a lot of improvements for date/time controls with help from Matt Johnson (yes, he does not work for our team, but he is one of the best date/time and timezone experts in the World, and it happened that he works for Microsoft so it would be stupid to not ask for his expert advice).\nThere is also one thing I need to rant about: Safari 9.x (and all earlier versions) does not support Internationalization API (Intl). We are using Intl API for numbers and currency formatting. At the beginning, when we were still in preview, we hoped that Safari will add Intl support soon (in a year or so), but it didn&#39;t happen. We had to use polyfill. Oh...actually I should rant about other issues we had with Safari (like Local Storage does not work in private mode), but you can check caniuse.com or just read an article: Safari is the new IE.\nIn addition to work on features, I also did a few improvements on our development workflow. From automation scripts, through some helper methods for unit testing, to speeding up local build time by changing MSBuild verbosity (printing to console takes time, in some cases we saved up to 1 minute of build time thanks to this simple trick!).\nSpeaking, traveling, conferences\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nOver the last year I have spoken at a few conferences, Seattle Code Camp, and gave a talk at SeattleJS meetup.\nI&#39;ve been speaking mostly about TypeScript, Azure Portal and Aurelia Framework (yes - the last one is totally not related to my day job).\nMy most recent talk about the Azure Portal architecture received a lot of great feedback. One gentleman told me that it was the best talk of the VSLive Redmond conference, somebody wrote a comment that it was the &quot;Most interesting non-scotthanselman presentation ever&quot;, and one person mentioned it (as &quot;excellent talk&quot;) in Azure Portal user voice (which I found while writing this post and searching for a link to Open Source Portal UI user request for previous section).\nOver last year I learned that going to talks at the conferences is the least important thing. The most important is to connect with people from outside of your everyday work environment, share experiences, and networking. The most interesting conversations don&#39;t happen during the presentations, but at the post conference dinner or after party. I really recommend to read chapter 14 of Never Eat Alone before attending a conference!\nWhen I am telling people that I travel around the World to speak at conferences, they think it looks like this:\n\nThey forgot that most of the time it looks like that:\n\nOf course there are pros and cons.\nPros:\n\nLearning new things (while preparing your talk, and during the conference from others).\nMeeting new people\nVisiting places you haven&#39;t been before. On my way to NDC London I paid from my own pocket for flight through Iceland with 34 hours connection flight in Reykjavik. I managed to see the Golden Circle, attend New Year&#39;s Concert at Harpa, and I&#39;ve seen the Northern Lights. I have also seen a little bit of London during the same trip\n\nCons:\n\nYou need to work after hours to learn and prepare talk for the conference. You also need to write a good abstract so you talk will be selected. This takes a lot of time!\nTravelling to conference takes time that you could spend with friends, family, or riding bike. Even if it is domestic flight it takes ~30 mins to get to airport, then ~2 hours on airport, ~2-4h during the flight, ~30 mins to get to the hotel etc. When it is on the other continent then you waste even more time + get jet lag. Oh...and you need to pack day before (~30 mins to 1 hour), and you don&#39;t have your nice 3 monitor setup and comfortable Herman Miller chair for a few days.\nSometimes you don&#39;t see anything except airport, aircraft, hotel and conference venue (that was the case when I went to ConnectJS conference in Atlanta and Open Source North in Minneapolis).\n\nThanks to speaking at conferences, I met a lot of interesting people, and definitely expanded my knowledge. What&#39;s important: I learned the most during one on one conversations in the hallway or at the conferences&#39; dinners.\nIn addition to conferences I was a guest at .NET Rocks podcast, where I talked about the Azure Portal. I was also interviewed by David Giard - who I met at Open Source North conference - for his Technology and Friends series. Sara Clayton - who works on Open Source at Microsoft, and who I met at the All Things Open conference - did an interview with me about my Open Source library: voiceCmdr. Jeremy Foster (who I met at SeattleJS meetup) did an interview with me for his CodeChat show (episode coming soon).\nLearning\n\nOver the last year I&#39;ve learned a lot about web development, performance, and accessibility. A lot of things I learned are captured in my last talk about the Azure Portal. I improved my coding skills, debugging skills, and also - mainly thanks to attending conferences - communication skills, which is very important in Software Engineer portfolio.\nIn my first year review I forgot to mention Microsoft Library, which is one of my favorites benefits at Microsoft. Most books I have read over last 2 years are from MS Library. I reviewed a few of them, and some landed in my favorite books list. The Pragmatic Programmer book said that you should read a technical book every quarter.\nLast time, I also didn&#39;t mention that when you are working on something related to Cloud, you have to be on-call once for a while. I am very lucky, because our team is large, and rotation requires everybody to be on-call only 1 week per 6-7 months. I have some friends who are on-call one of every three weeks, or even every other week (sic!). FYI - being on call means:\n\nno flexible work schedule\nno freedom (you need to be able to act on incident right away = you need to be close to your computer and Internet = you don&#39;t go hiking, you don&#39;t go out with friends, you don&#39;t go for a bike ride)\nI don&#39;t know what can be worse than your phone ringing at 4 am, and some people asking you for help with investigating some problem they cannot solve (hint: these people are not stupid, the problem is hard, your brain usually do not work the best in the middle of the night)\n\nHowever, there are also a good things in being on-call:\n\nyou can learn more about the project (when you need to investigate/diagnose something in the area you are not familiar with)\nyou can improve your debugging/investigating/diagnosing skills\nyou can meet new people across the company\n\nThe new thing for me, over last 12 months, was conducting interviews. It was very interesting experience. The most important thing I&#39;ve learned was to never skip the coding question. My interview usually contains 3 parts:\n\nchat about candidate previous projects/experience\neasy coding question\ndesign question\n\nThere will be more details in upcoming blog post, but if you are interviewing people, I really recommend you to check out The Guerrilla Guide to Interviewing (version 3.0) by Joel Spolsky.\nStaying fit and healthy\n\nWhen you are developer, you need to take care of your health. Sitting 10+ hours is not good for you. Sitting is the new smoking. Additionally it turns out that staying fit and healthy makes you better developer.\nI bike, I swim, I run, I hike, I take part in bike rides (like 206 miles Seattle to Portland, or 180 miles Seattle to Vancouver), and I compete in triathlons once for a while.\nStaying fit and healthy is not only about exercising. It is actually more about your diet:\n\nHowever, diet-miracle is not a way to go. Last year I tried to count calories I burn and consume throughout the day, and develop a diet I would be able to sustain for a long term. The trick is to realize that it is not worth to eat some things. E.g., this 500 calories cookie is not worth it. I would rather eat two Symphony bars from Hershey&#39;s. Oh...and you need to wait for results couple of months or so.\nIt&#39;s great that Microsoft cafeterias now provide calorie counts in the food menu. I am not eating these burgers that are 1400 calories, but other ones that have only 700. Together with Microsoft running trails it provides a great fitness bundle.\nThere are also other aspects you should take into account to stay healthy.\nOh...and I forgot to mention another awesome Microsoft benefit: Pro Club gym - one of the best gyms on the West Coast, and for sure the best in Seattle area. When I did a tour (right after I joined Microsoft 2 years ago), and the guy who was showing me around told me that they can service my car when I work out I was sure he was joking...he wasn&#39;t.\n\nWhat next?\nStay tuned!\n"

Do you know what it takes to make your website accessible?\nMaking your website accessible means providing the ability for everyone - regardless of disability or special needs - to use it.\nUnfortunately, if you put together all accessibility specifications and print it, the stack will be higher than CN Tower in Toronto:\n\nThis is not very encouraging. Many people think that it is not worth the effort because the customer base with special needs is significantly low. However, there is a thing called situational disability that applies to all of us. Moreover, when we are building our websites with accessibility in mind, we make them better for everyone. Why? Because everybody is more comfortable when allowed to fill out forms on a website using just a keyboard (without mouse) and able to switch between fields fast. Generally, everybody likes it when the focus is set on the search bar for sites because 99% of the time, the first thing you do is search for something. Everybody likes properly matched colors (accessible contrast).\nHow do you get started? How to survive without reading tons of specifications?\n3 steps to fulfill 80% standards with 20% effort\n\nMake your website usable with keyboard only:\n\nmake sure that focus outline is visible all the time and user can determine which element is currently focused\nno extra/unnecessary TAB stops\nno tabstop traps (when you cannot get out of an element with the keyboard)\n\n\nImplement smart focus management:\n\nset focus on appropriate elements after user actions (e.g., when a user navigates to a page with a login form – set the focus on the login text field; in 90% of the cases the next user action will be entering the login)\nrestore focus to appropriate elements after user actions (e.g., when a user closes a menu, focus should be restored to the element that was focused on before opening the menu)\nmake tab order user-friendly (remove non-actionable and non-informative tab stops)\n\n\nMake your website usable with screen reader:\n\nWhen element gets focused, screen reader should provide meaningful information to the user (e.g., &quot;image Satya Nadella&quot; when focused on Satya&#39;s image, or &quot;menu collapsed&quot; when focused on dropdown menu)\nMin bar: make it good enough with one screen reader and one browser first. As of 2016-08-22 the best browser + screen reader combination is Firefox + NVDA (it has a text mode that prints output instead of converting it into speech: Tools -&amp;gt; Speech viewer)\nAdd aria tags to elements only when the screen reader cannot infer information from HTML (e.g., button element does not need role=&#39;button&#39; as screen reader will infer it)\n\n\n\nGood to know\n\nDon&#39;t focus too much on &quot;being compliant to the standards&quot; at the beginning. Just use the common sense and your intuition. You can deep dive into the standards later on.\nMake your website&#39;s most common scenarios work well first and focus on less popular pages later.\nOnly 20% of accessibility requirements can be verified by tools. The rest has to be verified manually by:\n\nyourself\nuser study\nan accessibility expert\n\n\n\nResources to get started\n\nWeb Accessibility Tutorial\n\nEspecially: writing code checklist and design checklist\n\n\nWeb Accessibility Resources by Marcy Sutton\n\nEspecially: examples of accessible websites\n\n\nWeb Accessibility: Getting Started (Pluralsight)\nExamples:\n\nARIA examples\nOpen AJAX Accessibility examples\n\n\nTools:\n\naccessibility checkers\n\nAccessibility Developer Tools for Chrome\naXe: the Accessibility Engine (chrome plugin and axe-core.js - that can be used in your unit tests)\n\n\nScreen readers:\n\nNVDA (it has text mode that prints output instead of converting it into speech: Tools -&amp;gt; Speech viewer)\nJAWS\nNarrator\n\n\nContrast:\n\nColor contrast analyzer\nColor combinations matcher\nColor pallets you can use for your website\n\n\n\n\nW3C:\n\nDesign patterns/best practices, WAI-ARIA - when in doubt, check this succinct reference\nUsing ARIA in HTML\nARIA usage note - When you should use aria-* and when you should NOT\n[SVG] Role model diagram - what aria properties/states apply to particular elements\n\n\n\nSummary\nIf you are web developer you probably like when the tool you are using enables you to do everything without the mouse. This is thanks to keyboard accessibility, and smart focus management. If you play with color contrast analyzer you will notice that colors with good contrast are easier to read and simply just look better. Be aware that accessibility is about performance first. When your website is slow it can lead to unexpected focus behaviors, unwanted user actions, or moving content. How many times you tried to scroll to some part of website and it was moving because images were loading? I&#39;m sure a lot.\nWhat do you think? Is the website you are working on accessible? Have you ever even thought about it?\n\n"

    "content"  : "\nXamarin is a cross-platform mobile development framework that allows you to build native mobile applications with C# and share code between them. There are two approaches:\n\nnative Xamarin - write native UI code in C# (views cannot be shared, business logic can be shared)\nXamarin.Forms - write shared UI in XAML (native controls are being generated, and business logic can be shared as well)\n\n\nThe beauty of the first approach is ability to take advantage of Swift (iOS) or Java (Android) code samples, documentation, and community support. Swift/Java code can be easily translated into C#. In Xamarin.iOS app you have storyboards, ViewControllers and everything else you know from native iOS development. Similarly in Xamarin.Android - there are activities, fragments, action bars etc.\nXamarin.Forms on the other hand allows you to build apps faster. It&#39;s very good fit for business applications.\nWhich approach should you choose? Ask StackOverflow.\nResources to get started\nThe great way to get started with Xamarin is Xamarin University. You can also find variety of Xamarin courses at Pluralsight. I especially recommend Building Your First Xamarin.iOS App from Start to Store, Building Your First Xamarin.Android App from Start to Store, and Introduction to Xamarin.Forms.\nFriend of mine, James Montemagno (Developer Evangelist at Xamarin), runs video series Motz Codes Live where he explores different areas of Xamarin: from internals of MVVM, through Xamarin Inspector, to using Azure as backend for Xamarin mobile apps. You can also find a bunch of his videos from variety of conferences on youtube.\nAdditionally, there is a bunch of guides, recipes, and samples at Xamarin website. The official documentation is also a good source of knowledge.\nMany of you were asking about Xamarin.Forms on reddit. A lot has been changed in this area as well. Check out the latest, greatest Xamarin.Forms update from James on .NET Rocks:\n\nCode sharing strategies\nOne of the main advantages of Xamarin is code sharing. There are two ways to share code across platforms:\n\nPortable Class Library (PCL) - produces separated .dll\nShared Project - compiled into one assembly with platform specific projects (you can think about files in shared projects as they all are present in all platform specific projects)\n\nMost important differences:\n\nPCL can have referenced libraries, while shared project cannot.\nWhen we want to test shared code then in PCL case it is enough to reference PCL project only in the test project, while shared project requires additionally to add reference for all references that are being used by Shared Project.\nYou cannot have platform specific code in PCL, while shared project allows that using compiler directives.\n\nYou can learn more about code sharing here.\nTwo apps - two approaches\nA few months ago I created two mobile apps with Xamarin, for 3 platforms (iOS, Android, UWP) and published them to 3 stores (App Store, Google Play, Windows Store):\n\nShopping Pad - smart shopping list that allows you not only to create a shopping list, but also remembers items that you have purchased in the past, how often they have been purchased, and based on that suggests items for your next grocery store trip.\nBread Crumbs - enables you to save your current location, and you can navigate to it later on (useful if you are in the new city, and you want to comeback to some place that you are &quot;currently at&quot;)\n\nIn Shopping Pad I used Portable Class Library to share code between platforms. In Bread Crumbs - Shared Project. I used SQLite for persistence in both apps, and the only difference I experienced was in creating SQLite connections. In PCL you need to create connection on &quot;platform project&quot; (you cannot do it from PCL). Shared Project allows you to use conditional compilation, and instantiate connection(s) in one file (using compiler directives).\nI created unit tests (with xUnit) for Shopping Pad, and I was able to test entire app logic (for 3 platforms!) with only one test project. No platform specific code. Awesome!\nMany times when I was looking for a solution to particular problem, I was able to reuse native iOS (Objective-C/Swift) or Android (Java) code samples, and translate them into C#.\nEven for these two, small apps, shared code reuse was significant during development process. Especially in keeping consistency across platforms.\nBoth apps are available on App Store, Google Play, and Windows Store (Shopping Pad, Bread Crumbs).\nTips &amp;amp; Tricks\nThe struggle you may (and you probably will) experience at the beginning is platform setup. I recommend you to use Visual Studio simulators for Android (with Hyper-V) - they are faster. You need to have XCode installed on your Mac in order to run iOS apps built with Xamarin.\nI develop Xamarin apps with Visual Studio on my ThinkPad X1, and use Mac only as host for running iOS apps. Some people run Windows on Mac with Parallels. Others use Xamarin Studio for iOS and Android, and switch to Windows only for UWP development. This will minimize the number of configuration issues, but will also give you worse development experience. I find Visual Studio much nicer for C#, and also for Xamarin development.\nXamarin - Windows Setup guide and Xamarin - Mac OS X Setup guide can help you get through configuration process. There is also fresh post from James about Setting Up Xamarin on Surface Book.\nDuring mobile apps development with Xamarin you will encounter some problems that will not occur when developing pure native apps with Swift and Java. To save you some time, here are the list of a few of typical problems, together with solutions:\n\nProblem: connecting with iOS host sometimes will not work. Solution: update your Mac (and XCode), update Xamarin plugin for Visual Studio, make sure your XCode path in Visual Studio settings is correct, and restart both machines. If it does not help check other solutions here.\nProblem: iOS simulators not visible in Visual Studio. Solution: link.\nProblem: Error: &quot;Failed to add reference to &#39;System.Collections&#39;. Please make sure that it is in the Global Assembly Cache.&quot;. Solution: add, manually, Droid/iOS dlls to references.\nProblem: free provisioning Xamarin.iOS app. Solution: this guide.\nGeneric solution for many problems: restart Visual Studio (seriously, I&#39;ve seen many StackOverflow questions where somebody was wondering why something does not work, and then &quot;oh...after restarting Visual Studio it started working&quot;).\n\nOne, not Xamarin specific tip: if want to have relations in SQLite database? Use SQLite-Net Extensions.\nPublishing apps to stores\nAndroid - bananas! Seconds for auto-validation, and ~3 hours to the store. I didn&#39;t encounter any problems except copyrights for Bread Crumbs app icon, which I had to change. It was automatically detected! Impressive! This guide is more than enough to guide you through the process.\niOS - ~20 minutes for auto-validation, and ~4(!) days to the store. You can check current wait times here. Creating app bundle might be a little bit challenging. I was able to figure it out with Xamarin guide and this gist (I recommend option 2).\nWindows Store - ~3h for auto-validation, and ~1 day to the store. I had my apps rejected, despite the fact that they were working on Windows machine, and on Windows Phone Device (Lumia 920). There were 2 issues:\n\nReferencing incorrect SQLite assembly: &quot;SQLite for Universal App Platform&quot; instead of &quot;SQLite for Universal Windows Platform&quot;.\nI didn&#39;t test apps with with .NET Native (Project properties &amp;gt; Build &amp;gt; Compile with .NET Native Tool Chain), and one app was crashing during verification process. After debugging with .NET Native I was able to repro, diagnose and fix the problem.\n\nSummary\nXamarin is not only sunshine and rainbows. You will have problems you wouldn&#39;t when developing native apps, but also - you do not have some problems you would have when developing native apps. Check discussion about pros and cons of using Xamarin at Hacker News: Some thoughts after (almost) a year of real Xamarin use.\nBe aware that there are also other cross-platform mobile frameworks, e.g., Apache Cordova, React Native, or NativeScript .\nSince this year, Xamarin is free for Students, OSS projects and small teams (up to 5 people). You can use Visual Studio (including free Visual Studio Community Edition) or free Xamarin Studio Community Edition. That means - now you can use Xamarin for FREE!\n\nHappy development!\nLet me know in comments if you have any questions about developing apps with Xamarin!\n"

Erik calls this stage: &quot;Expert Beginner&quot;. This leads to stagnation, and no interest to improve. What&#39;s worse it affects their coworkers.\nI really recommend you to read The Expert Beginner. It&#39;s quick read (68 pages), and may help you not fall into this trap.\n"

    "content"  : "This blog is hosted on Azure. It is using WordPress, which stores its data in MySQL database hosted by ClearDb. I blogged about the issues with WordPress database size over a year ago. The issue is inserting transient entries into database that are growing its size and exceeding free 20MB ClearDB limit. As I mentioned in this blog post - you can use plugins that clear database for you, or...you can use web jobs. Azure WebJobs is very neat way to perform custom tasks, such as database maintenance, periodically.\nI created a web job that is performing database maintenance for me. Everyday it removes &#39;transient&#39; entries from wp_options table to keep my MySQL database under 20MB ClearDB limit.\nOne problem was: how to do MySQL backup without mysqldump? As you know, there is a Virtual Machine underneath every Azure website. And this VM has MySQL, along with mysqldump installed:\n\nBased on this article I created a small Console App called DbMaintenance that performs 3 mentioned tasks:\n\nBackup database\nRemove transient entries from wp_options table.\nBackup database\n\nTwo backups gives me more confidence that I have my database backed up correctly. Especially because I am performing them before and after the operation that potentially can broke things.\nYou can customize my app by editing Initialize method. Current paths (for mysqldump and database backup directory) are set for Azure Website. Additionally you have to create directory for backups (D:\\home\\db-backups). You can do it from the web app console available on the Azure Portal:\nmkdir D:\\home\\db-backup\nOnce this is done, you need to zip DbMaintenance.exe and MySql.Data.dll file, and create a WebJob. On the Azure Portal go to your web app -&amp;gt; Settings -&amp;gt; WebJobs, and add a new WebJob:\n\nYou can see the status in Settings -&amp;gt; WebJobs -&amp;gt; YOUR_JOB_NAME:\n\nBy clicking on logs column, you can get details about web job:\n\nAnd console output from each execution:\n\nI configured my WebJob to run everyday. You can also run it on demand, or continuously.\nYou can find more about Azure WebJobs in this article.\n"

    "content"  : "\ntl;dr This post is a list of resources for learning F# and overview of my mini-project: Stock Estimator.\nI couldn&#39;t resist anymore, and I finally tried F#. For the first two days it was painful. Some elements of F# syntax are weird. However after getting use to that, F# became a joy, and instead of a week (as I planned) I spent with F# almost two months.\nGetting Started\n\nF# Jumpstart (Pluralsight) 1h 25m - brief introduction to F#, good for the beginning the get the sneak peak\nIntroduction to F# by Don Syme (part1, part2, part3)\nF# Cheatsheet - great overview of F# features\nF# for C# Developers by Phillip Trelford\nUnderstanding the World with F# by Tomas Petricek\nTry F# - interactive tutorial for learning F# (works only in IE because of Silverlight)\nFunctional Koans - F# - collection of F# exercises inspired by Ruby koans that requires you to fix failing unit tests one by one (fun and informative!)\n\nDeep Dive\n\nF# for beginners by Sacha Barber (Microsoft MVP) - extensive overview of almost all features of F# language (good as reference)\nAccessing Data with F# Type Providers (Pluralsight) by Tomas Petricek (2h 14m)\nF# Functional Data Structures (Pluralsight) (3h 44m) - deep dive into F# Data Structures\nType-Driven Development with F# (Pluralsight) by Mark Seemann (3h 56m)\nF# for fun and profit - solid source of knowledge to learn more about F# (when you know the basics)\nfsharp.org - encyclopedia of resources for all topics related to F#\nF# Advent Calendar 2014 and 2015 - set of articles about different topics related to F#\nDomain modelling with the F# type system by Scott Wlaschin\nRailway Oriented Programming — error handling in functional languages by Scott Wlaschin\nDomain-Driven Design, Event Sourcing and CQRS with F# and EventStore by Lev Gorodinski\n\nThere is also a book written by Jon Skeet and Tomas Petricek: Real World Functional Programming: With Examples in F# and C#.\nTesting\n\nUnit Testing with F# (Pluralsight) by Mark Seemann (1h 32m)\nIntroduction to Property-based Testing with F# (Pluralsight) by Mark Seemann (1h 34m)\nTest-Driven Development with F# (Pluralsight) by Mark Seemann (2h 17m)\n\nWeb Development\nThe most popular F# Web Framework is Suave. There is great SuaveMusicStore tutorial (code), which is inspired by ASP.NET MVC Music Store tutorial. If you want to build Web API with F#, check Building REST Api in Fsharp Using Suave.\nIt is also worth to check End-to-end Functional Web Development by Tomas Petricek where he showcases building web app with Suave.\nFor more, check Web Programming with F# Guide.\nStock Estimator\nI created F# based app for predicting future stock prices ($1,000,000 idea!). The back-end is written in F#, and communicates with stock data API (Yahoo Finance) through F# type provider. There is also Suave Web API (microservice), and ASP.NET Core web app that communicates with it. Front-end is powered by Aurelia Framework, and D3 library. In other words: I built F# microservice, consumed it from non-F# app, and have reusable logic in separated project. All communication with microservice happens through the client (with Aurelia Framework). So, there is no usage of F# from C#, but...I also created simple Console app (with C#) that uses mentioned F# logic. There is also Windows Forms app for displaying estimates, written in F#, that also use reusable logic.\nEntire source code is available on github. Check it out!\nSummary\nProgramming in F# is pure joy! It&#39;s a great language for working with data. Moreover, F# fits perfectly into today&#39;s World of microservices. You don&#39;t have to rewrite your already existing app, or create entire app with F#. You can just create one microservice with F#, and see how it works for you!\n"

Especially, because instead of having more talks that I could count, there was only 15 sessions (selected out of over 300) divided into 3 tracks. Moreover, all speakers were passionate developers, and you could feel this during their presentations.\nI had a pleasure to met John-David Dalton - creator of lodash, who use to work at Microsoft for Chakra team, and now is working for Microsoft Edge team. I really enjoyed his talk on JavaScript performance. I also met Kyle Simpson - the author of You Don&#39;t Know JS book series and awesome Pluralsight course: Advanced JavaScript. He presented inspiring keynote on choosing simplicity over easiness.\nI also attended very good session - Maybe We Should Slow Down by Blaine Bublitz (author of over 400 npm packages). Blaine was convincing developers to think twice before contributing code, and publish only features they have high confidence about.\nThe coolest talk of the conference was JS in Near Space by Pawel Szymczykowski. I really recommend you to check it out. Pawel, together with his friends built a small space ship, powered by Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, and they are sending them into &quot;Near Space&quot;, up to ~100 000 ft altitude (Boeing 737 flies at &amp;lt;40 000 ft).\nActually, I have seen all talks (in person, or on youtube), and all of them were well prepared. There was no single talk about which I could tell that speaker was not good, or not prepared. You can check them out here:\n\nThunder Plains is community event organized by 3 passionates - Vance Lucas, Jesse Harlin and Amanda Harlin - who did a really good job in taking care of everything.

    "content"  : "This blog post is an overview of testing focus behavior in web browser.\nDuring the work on Azure Portal I spent quite a bit of time on ensuring rich keyboard support. This requires appropriate focus management. When user press some keyboard shortcut, the focus should move to appropriate element. There is a good article on MDN about Keyboard-navigable JavaScript widgets. Focus behavior should be also tested very succinctly. As it is very easy to change (break) with even the smallest change in the HTML or JavaScript.\nStandard test goes as follows:\n\nArrange: open some page\nAct: execute some keyboard shortcut that should open particular page and/or set focus on particular element\nAssert: check if expected element is focused\n\nHow to check if element is focused\nThe simplest way is to use jQuery:\n\nexpect($(element).is(&#39;:focus&#39;)).equals(true);\n\nHowever this may not always work. Especially if you run your unit tests in parallel, because $element.is(&#39;:focus&#39;) will not work when window does not have focus.\nThe better (right) way is to use document.activeElement:\n\nexpect(document.activeElement).equals(element);\n\nThis will work even when browser window is not focused.\nTesting async actions\nSometimes, keyboard invoke asynchronous actions that eventually will change focus. This can cause:\n\nfalse negative tests: assertion was executed before focus was eventually set\nfalse positives: finally focused element, got focus after assertion was executed\n\nThe simplest recipe for the first problem is to delay assertion:\n\nsetTimeout(() =&amp;gt; {\n    expect(document.activeElement).equals(element);\n    done();\n}, 100);\n\nThe problem with this approach is choosing appropriate delay for assertion. Therefore it is better to avoid raw setTimeout, and use polling approach that I described in my post setTimeout considered harmful:\n\npoll(\n  () =&amp;gt; document.activeElement === element, \n  () =&amp;gt; {\n        assert(true);\n        start();\n  },\n  () =&amp;gt; {\n        assert(false);\n        start();\n  }\n);\n\nThe polling function can be also used for the second solution (by changing assertion order in callback functions). However, for the false positives problem, simple setTimeout is good enough, because we do not have a choice other than wait some particular period of time to execute assertion.\nInvoking keyboard actions\nThere are 3 types of events that we can use to simulate keyboard action:\n\nkeydown\nkeyup\nkeypress\n\nThe safest bet is to use keydown. Why? An example might be using special keys. While in case of keypress - various browsers handle it differently (e.g., by not triggering the event), keydown is pretty consistent. I recommend you to check this article if you are interested in details. It was not updated for some time, but it will give you an idea.\nIn order to detect keyboard actions you may handle events on capture or bubbling phase. You should choose model depending on your needs, but in general bubbling phase is optimal solution. Additionally it is supported by jQuery, with browser inconsistencies taken care of for you.\nTo invoke keydown event in your tests, you need to set focus on the element first:\n\n$(element)\n  .focus()\n  .trigger(&quot;keydown&quot;, { which: keyCode });\n\nYou can find JavaScript key codes here.\nSummary\nUse document.activeElement to check which element is focused.\nUse polling approach for testing async actions.\nUse keydown event, and bubble phase to invoke/handle keyboard actions.\n"

    "content"  : "\nDuring this Christmas time I had an reflection about being nice vs being honest (aka being an a**hole).\nSome people don&#39;t care, and just say what they think. Sometimes, they even exaggerate to be more convincing, or to show their level of confidence. An example may be this Linus Tornvalds&#39; response to his fellow developer. Of course people shouldn&#39;t do that. They should consider other peoples&#39; feelings, their point of view and think twice before saying something (BTW: check Dale Carnegie&#39;s book). But as we know - the World isn&#39;t perfect.\nI also noticed that there are many people who are trying to fix the World by encouraging everybody to &quot;be nice&quot;. Which is a good thing but...\nSooner or later, especially if you are developer, you will encounter some &quot;mean&quot; person in your life. When this happen, I have an advice for you: DO NOT TAKE THIS PERSONAL. Of course, first you need to answer the fundamental question: should I care? If so, then instead of getting depressed, and complaining &quot;how mean this guy is&quot;, try to translate what he is saying to nice language, and learn from it. Taking Linus example:\n&quot;SHUT THE FUCK UP!&quot; == &quot;I disagree&quot;\n&quot;Fix your f*cking &#39;compliance tool&#39;, because it is obviously broken.&quot; == &quot;I think you should change it&quot;\nI will tell you more: you should actually feel bad for people who cannot communicate effectively, because in the long run it will hurt them. Not you...as long as you will NOT TAKE THIS PERSONAL. Even more: you should be grateful for them. They are telling you what they really think, instead of hiding the true in order to be nice.\nDisclaimer: I am assuming that the &quot;mean person&quot; is somebody who you think is a smart person, and you care about their opinion. If rudeness comes from person who you do not think is the smartest person, then it is even easier: you should just ignore it. Many people try to get attention this way. Actually I am still amazed how effective this technique is.\nBe aware that the most of the smartest people in our industry are actually not very nice. Alan Kay, during this amazing talk The computer revolution hasn&#39;t happened yet, said this:\nI don&#39;t know how many of you have ever met Dijkstra (one of the most influential members of computing science&#39;s founding generation), but you probably know that arrogance in computer science is measured in nano-Dijkstras.\nBe nice, and Happy New Year!\n\n"

    "content"  : "\nFrom time to time I receive emails with questions &quot;How to become better/awesome developer?&quot;, &quot;Should I go to college?&quot;, &quot;what&#39;s the secret formula to become ultimate programmer?&quot;. Instead of answering the same questions over, and over again - providing only partial response each time - I decided to write this blog post.\nShould I go to college?\n\nIt&#39;s a very hard question. Especially from perspective of person who went to 3 Universities (and graduated from all of them). Thus, instead of telling you whether you should or should not go to College, I will tell you what are the benefits of going to College.\nFirst, and foremost - the opportunity to connect with other people. Better the school is - better connections you can make. This is the real value of going to Harvard or Stanford instead of Community College. Not outstanding professors who owns secret formula that they are sharing only with their students. Of course professors at top Universities are usually better than at non-top Universities, but they do not have recipe to teach you something without your own initiative. Did you know that Stanford, and MIT publish some of their classes online, for FREE? Why you do not just study these classes instead going to college? You can, but this is like watching the moon landing from home instead of being in the space craft. This is also the reason why top schools accept only ~2% of candidates. They want to have only the smartest people to hangout together, and then have successful careers. This makes school prestigious.\nThe second benefit is being forced to learn things that have steep learning curve, are not very fun at the beginning, but are definitely worth to know while being developer. Most of them are actually very exciting when you connect all pieces together.\n\nCheck out my other blog post: 10 things you should learn at University.\nWhen you will have opportunity to choose classes to attend - first choose professors, then subjects. From my experience - when I wasn&#39;t interested in some topic, but professor was good - I liked the class, and I learned a lot. On the other hand - when I was very interested in some topic, but professor wasn&#39;t great - I always regretted, because I probably could have learnt more by myself.\nBefore making your decision, get familiar with opinion of people who recommend you to go to College (e.g., Joel Spolsky), or with those who definitely tells you to do not (e.g., DHH). You should also take into consideration path of those who went to College, and drop (e.g., Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg). Be aware that educational system has its issues that are amazingly explained by Sir Ken Robinson in the most watched TED talk ever Do schools kill creativity?, and Peter Thiel in one of interviews. Remember that university education is not life insurance policy. It may work exactly opposite.\nI do not remember who said that, but I agree:\nThe best programmers learnt Computer Science at School, and programming by themselves.\nWhat language should I learn?\n\nMost of experienced programmers will tell you: &quot;whichever is your favorite, because you can do cool stuff in C#, but also in Ada, e.g., by writing Software for Boeing 787&quot;. And they are right! But I feel sorry for those beginners who will try to start with Ada, because it is very likely that at the time when they will be getting their first program to compile, those who had chosen C# would already have full CRUD application with Database deployed on Azure.\nMy answer for this question is: learn C# and JavaScript.\nWhy C#? &quot;C# is a better Java&quot;, and those two (C# and Java) are currently the most popular compiled programming languages. Thus, there are a lot of code samples, tutorials, and community support.\nWhy JavaScript? Because it is the most popular programming language that allows you to write programs for the most popular platform: web browser.\nExtra credit: learn also C/C++ to learn pointers, and how memory allocation works. I would even recommend you to try to write some assembly: to understand how variables are stored in the processor registers, and memory. Then spend 7 weeks with this book: Seven languages in seven weeks. Hint: after you learn first programming language, learning each next will be getting easier. There is also a great, GREAT book that will help you to understand how computers work: The Elements of Computing Systems.\nYou may hear from more experienced programmers that you shouldn&#39;t try just learn another language, but to build something. Unfortunately, the difference between you and them is usually number of the languages you both know. You: 1 or 2, them: more than 5. Because of that, they are able to pick up language basics in one night, and start building something right a way. They already know how to use common programming constructs - such as loops, functions, classes - and how to use them efficiently. For you: it would be much harder.\nIt&#39;s good to be proficient in one language, and know how to use a few other. I think it was Albert Einstein who said:\nKnow everything about something, and something about everything.\nHow to get a job when I do not have any industry experience?\n\nCreate something. Whatever. Really! That&#39;s the most popular advice from experienced programmers. While it&#39;s true, the problem is that it is much easier to say and understand, when you already have done that. For somebody who is really entering the market for the first time - it is not that obvious. So, here, I will tell you what to do: Create a website that will allow you to browse, add, edit and delete books. Then add possibility to login, and roles for admins (who can do everything) and standard users (who can only browse books). Once you have this, create a mobile app that will allow you to browse these books like the website, and later on, also edit/delete when you are logged in as admin. You can get books from your website by creating API that will return data in JSON format.\nWhat technology to use? You can do it in ASP.NET MVC using MSSQL Database (with Entity Framework). You can also use Node.js with Express Framework, and MongoDB database. On top of that you can use some SPA Framework like AngularJS, ReactJS, or Aurelia, to make your app more cool. For mobile app - Windows Phone is the easiest for beginner. You can also try iOS or Android if you want to. The best move would be of course to implement it for all 3 platforms. You can create native apps in C#, Objective-C/Swift, and Java, or you can use Xamarin (C#) or Apache Cordova (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).\nBTW: You can learn all technologies mentioned above at Pluralsight. I really recommend you to get an account there. You can check popular courses list as a tip what it currently hot and worth to learn.\nWhen your app is ready, publish it on github, and deploy to Azure or AWS, or Google Cloud, or to all of these platforms. Use FREE trials if you do not want to pay, or even better - figure out how to do not spend too much money when using Cloud.\nAre you done? I hope you didn&#39;t do it exactly how I said, or you did multiple versions of slightly different applications using different tools. Great! Now, you can show it to your future employer, and tell him that you are already capable to deliver software from your first day at work. You can put it in your resume, in &#39;projects&#39; section, and describe it: &quot;I created a website for book collection management with user authentication, and authorization. Additionally I created companion mobile apps for 3 most popular mobile platforms (iOS, Android and Windows Phone) that communicates with database through RESTful API&quot;. If you will have thing, when you graduate from Collage, you will already beat 95% of other students, and - I am assuring you - this will give you your first job for 99%. From then - you will figure things out!\nIf you want to work for some of the top, tech companies like Microsoft, Google, or Facebook, I recommend you to learn a lot about algorithms. Take as many algorithms classes as possible at school, read books (1, 2, 3), and practice, practice, practice. These companies don&#39;t care whether you can program in Java, even if you are applying for Java Programmer position. What they care about is whether you are smart, and can get things done. I really recommend to check out Sean Lee&#39;s talk How to Get a Job at the Big 4 - Amazon, Facebook, Google &amp;amp; Microsoft - it&#39;s not only about getting job at particular companies, but it&#39;s also a great career advice.\nHow can I improve my coding skills?\n\nWrite code. A lot! Really. Write code everyday. You can create some simple applications, like todo list, or shopping list app, or personal finances calculator. I know all of these exists, but you are going to learn by reinventing the wheel. If you want to create something more complex - go for it! Look at this women who built 180 websites in 180 days. The good way to practice programming is to compete in programming contests.\nRead books to learn from more experienced programmers, and to discover what we know about programming today. If you want some reading recommendations check list of my favorite books, or all books I have read.\nCheck out podcast Be a better Developer in 6 months by Scott Hanselman, and article by Peter Norvig (Director of Research at Google) - Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years.\nYou can also take a look at Google&#39;s Technical Development Guide - recommendations and resources that will help you to become developer from Google.\nGet Involved!\n\nThere is an amazing, free Pluralsight production by Scott Hanselman and Rob Connery - Get Involved! Check this out. Then start a blog, create twitter and github accounts, subscribe to some podcasts (e.g., Hanselminutes, .NET Rocks, This Developer&#39;s life, StackOverflow podcast), and go to some conference for developers, local meetup, or Code Camp. Pro tip: when you want to learn something - submit proposal for local meetup, student Computer Science group, or conference about the topic that you are interested in, and would like to dive in. This will give you motivation to learn.\nRemember about soft skills\n\nWhat many developers underestimate is the value of soft skills. Please read Dale Carnegie&#39;s How to win Friends and influence people, and Chad Fowler&#39;s  The Passionate Programmer. Maybe at the very beginning of your career it doesn&#39;t matter that much, but at some point you will notice how important is communication, and ability to interact with people.\nSummary\nI know you would like to be an awesome coder tomorrow, but this takes time. Be patient, work hard, and after some time you will realize that you are a good programmer. However, remember to maintain and improve your skills everyday, like athletes do with everyday training.\nGood luck!\n\n"

    "content"  : "Last month I had a pleasure to speak at ConnectJS and All Things Open conferences.\nConnectJS\n\nConnectJS was not only about JavaScript, but about web development in general. There was even track dedicated for UI Design and User eXperience. The most popular during the conference were talks about ES6/ES2015 and React.\nI delivered two sessions:\nTDD with TypeScript, AngularJS and Node.js\n// video coming soon\nCode\nAurelia - the next generation Framework you will love\n// video coming soon\nCode\nI addition to my talks I attended the following sessions:\nEverything I Needed to Know, I Learned in Rabbinical School (Yitzchok Willroth) - this session was about sharing knowledge, and cooperation between developers. One thing I noticed, not only at conferences, but also at local meetups in Seattle area is that many people would like to go and speak at the conferences, but &quot;they aren&#39;t doing anything interesting in day-to-day job and they are not expert in anything&quot;. They should have been at this session. Yitzchok was explaining how you can help others, and engage in Open Source. Moreover, he emphasized one, simple truth: every developer has something interesting to share.\nBuilding Web Sites that Work Everywhere (Doris Chen) - very useful overview of web compatibility problems, and recommendation of tools that can help with that, like Autoprefixer. I also liked the quote from Patrick Lauke: &quot;The userAgent property is ever-growing pack of lies&quot;. Doris recommended that we should prefer feature detection over relying on userAgent strings.\nRe-evaluating Front-end Performance Best Practices (Ben Vinegar) - the most important lesson learned at this session is the fact that whatever you find in JavaScript books written 2+ years ago might be already obsolete. Moreover, whatever you learn today, might be obsolete tomorrow. This is definitely not a good news for developers, but we need to deal with that and when reading anything on the web - thinking for ourselves.\nVideo killed the Telephone Star (Ben Klang) - WebRTC is coming to the browser. In this talk Ben demonstrated web app that allows to do a video conference (his implementation of Google Hangouts in Rails).\nLessons learned with TypeScript and ES2015 (Dylan Schiemann) - it was an overview of TypeScript and ES6 based on experience working on Dojo 2 Framework - the second largest application written in TypeScript (after Azure Portal). After this presentation I talked to Dylan, and he showed me another projects his company SitePen is working on: Intern - very flexible and powerful testing framework, and Mayhem - JS Framework written in TypeScript (still under development).\nFunctional Programming Basics in ES6 (Jeremy Fairbank) - tips&amp;amp;tricks you can do in JavaScript(ES6), but you cannot in OO strongly typed languages like C# or Java.\nLessons from Open Source @ Scale (Christine Abernathy) - Facebook has over 300 repos in github (after this talk I checked how many Microsoft have - almost 300). Christine explained how they help community by delivering Open Source, and how community helps them by contributing to their software.\nIntroducing Trix (Javan Makhmali, Sam Stephenson) - Javan and Sam created web based text editor, and they open sourced it right after this talk.\nThe rise of &quot;API&quot; first applications (Travis Tidwell) - this talk was about Micro Services, and modern applications architecture where we have multiple, independent endpoints responsible for one functionality each.\nIt Was Like That When I Got Here (Paul M. Jones) - it was a great talk about approaching legacy applications, and refactoring techniques. I enjoyed it even despite the fact that Paul was using PHP examples...I actually felt a bit sentimental as PHP was a language that get me started with Web Development when I was back in middle/high school :)\nAll Things Open\n\nAll Things Open is one of the largest Open Source conferences in the United States. This year there was over 1700 attendees, and 13 tracks!\nI gave a talk about TDD with TypeScript, AngularJS, and Node.js - the same as at ConnectJS.\n\nOn a day before the conference there was 5k run/sightseeing event at the evening. It was exactly what I needed before 2 days of seating. Kudos for organizers :)\nMost of my time during the conference I spent in the room with front-end related sessions. Carina C. Zona explained problems with artificial intelligence and machine learning - Consequences of an Insightful Algorithm. Seth Vargo made an overview of Vargant - product that allows to create and configure universal development environment for every developer in the team. Christian Heilmann was encouraging people to learn JavaScript, ECMAScript 6, and to stop supporting old browsers, such as IE8, that has security vulnerabilities. Yehuda Katz explained how he and other contributors of Ember.js created version 2 without breaking a lot of APIs from version 1, and thus allowing developers for a smooth transition. I also liked the session about Netflix architecture by Andrew Spyker. I wish Andrew had more time to explain details more deeply. The surprising takeaway is that Netflix has 3x of everything. Which means - for every server, service and API they have additional 2 redundant.\nThe most widely commented session at the conference was keynote by Mark Russinovich. I was pretty surprised that people were surprised by Microsoft doing so much Open Source. For me this is a known fact for a few years now, but it seems that the rest of the World doesn&#39;t know yet, and still see Microsoft as closed-source corporation that want to lock you in their technology.Well...that&#39;s not true anymore. I also had a pleasure to met Christian Heilmann - former Evangelist of Mozilla who joined Microsoft with one mission: kill the Internet Explorer. I really enjoyed his session on ES6, and keynote.\nAt the speaker dinner I had a pleasure to seat at the table with Andrew Spyker from Netflix, Michael Laing of New York Times, Christine Abernathy from Facebook, and Eric Martindale - entrepreneur from Silicon Valley. We had interesting conversation of the future of Netflix, Internet Television, bitcoin, and digital newspapers. I also learned that New York Times is the only news paper that is profitable in the transition from paper to electronic.\nAt All Things Open I finally got awesome Ninja Cat stickers:\n\n"

    "content"  : "Last week I had a pleasure to speak at Strange Loop and NCDevCon.\nStrange Loop\nAt the Strange Loop I presented Aurelia - the next generation JavaScript Framework:\n\nStrange Loop is an intersection of everything: from Researchers, through programmers maintaining 20 years old systems that still works, Web Developers using the latest Frameworks (like React), Web Developers using mature (AKA &#39;old&#39;) frameworks (like Spring), DevOps deploying with Docker, large scale distributed systems architects, to Common Lisp fans. The most important thing is - most of the people at this conference are real passionate programmers. I really recommend you to check out Sam Aaron&#39;s session: Beating Threads - live coding with real time. Sam is a researcher who created programming environment that allows you to compose music by writing code. Something that can be used today, which is cool, and he presented it with such a passion that cannot be described by words.\nAll videos from Strange Loop are available on their YouTube channel.\nIf you think that now everyone is creating Web Apps and Mobile Apps - go to Strange Loop! You will see a different World.\n\nNCDevCon\nI&#39;ve been at NCDevCon only for the day two, because of overlap with Strange Loop, and I presented how TypeScript helps to build large scale applications. Unfortunately, there is no video from my session, because just before my talk there was a power outage. I, and other speakers (if they still had battery), had to present from laptops while people were looking from behind our shoulders.\n\nI gave similar talk earlier this year at .NET Developers meetup in Redmond. You can find video and slides in this blog post.\nAt NCDevCon I&#39;ve seen only 3 sessions, because 1 hour after my session, in addition to power outage, the fire alarm started beeping, and the rest of the conference was cancelled. Videos from day 1, and maybe some from day 2 (if speakers record them at home) will be available at NCDevCon.com.\nThis conference was more down to Earth for me, as everybody was talking about Web and Mobile. You can find more detailed overview in this blog post.\nOn my way back from Raleigh, NC (where NCDevCon took place) I had connection flight in Minneapolis, MN. This gave me an opportunity to see the airport of XXI century: power outlets everywhere, free WiFi, and iPads for free public use (utilized also for ordering food at restaurants).\n\n\n\n\n"

The assumption was that people from, e.g., New Zealand might have slow connection issues (timeouts) more likely than people from USA or Europe. I couldn&#39;t find any tool that does that, so I put a simple website at ipheatmap.azurewebsites.net. The main page use geoip-lite node library to geolocate IP address.

I didn&#39;t have to do any special configuration to get it work. I didn&#39;t even have to leave the Azure Portal to lookup github url, because it fetches all available repos automatically after you provide your credentials.

    "content"  : "I joined Microsoft on September 8, 2014. Today is my first year anniversary.\n\nHow do I get the job at Microsoft\nWhen I was in College/Grad School, I wanted to work for Microsoft, because of Scott Hanselman, Scott Guthrie, Steve Sanderson, Damian Edwards, Mads Kristensen, Anders Hejlsberg, Eric Lippert, and other great developers. However, I knew them only from their blogs, and conference talks. I didn&#39;t know how day-to-day work at Microsoft looks like. When I was organizing dotNetConfPL 2013 I talked to Tomasz Janczuk, who worked for Microsoft for over 12 years, and he told me that &quot;it is definitely worth it to work for Microsoft if you want to learn how to make software&quot;. After that, I was sure, I wanted to work for Microsoft.\nIn 2013, recruiter from Microsoft came to my department at Kansas State University, and after collecting resumes, selected group of people for on-campus interviews. I was one of them. Two weeks later I had 30 minutes interview on campus. It was short 5 minutes introduction, and 25 minutes of coding. After a week I got an email informing me that I was recommended for the next round - on-site interview in Redmond. Two months later I flew from Manhattan, KS to Redmond, WA. Interview in Redmond was a set of 5 interviews, with 5 different people, 1 hour each. Every interviewer was asking briefly about myself, and then programming question. What was surprising for me, they asked me to write code in Visual Studio. Two weeks after the interview I got an offer, which I accepted and on September 2014 I joined the Azure Portal Team.\nWhat have I done during my first year\nI am working for the Azure Portal Framework team, which is delivering the core of the portal, and framework to build extensions on top of it. Each Extension, e.g. Websites, Virtual Machines, or Application Insights, is a gateway to underlying Azure infrastructure. Framework team is divided in a few subgroups. My group is responsible mainly for developing reusable controls that are part of the framework. I created a few controls, and I was fixing/improving some other. The most challenging one was to create a set of date/time controls. Why was it hard? Because JavaScript Date sucks, and it is not easy to deal with date/time at all.\nIn addition to controls, I was also working on keyboard support for the Portal, and keyboard shortcuts that I blogged about earlier this year (here and here). Now, it is possible to use the portal with keyboard only.\nI also helped to improve our development experience. I proposed to add Sinon.JS to our testing tool-set, and helped to create strong-typed wrapper on top of it - TypeSinon (which was proposed by Steve Sanderson). In order to make our QUnit tests cleaner, I also proposed and integrated QUnit Parametrize plugin that works like TestCase attribute in NUnit. I did other small improvements, like helping to upgrade to TypeScript 1.5, and turning off verbose printing to the console during build - which saves a few dev-minutes everyday, and ultimately a few dev-hours or even days per year.\nLessons learned\nThe best thing about working at Microsoft is the opportunity to work with smart people, and learn from them. All developers working at Microsoft are this type of people who get things done. They do not like to talk too much about what they want to do, but they prefer doing it instead. I remember when once I was arguing with some people over the email that something should be than in one way, not the other. After a few e-mails one teammate told me: &quot;If you really believe that something should be done in some way, do not argue with people, just do it&quot;. I also noticed that the best developers do not ask you to do something for them, but send out a Code Review instead.\nIn my team there is no fear to try new things. Do you want to use the latest version of TypeScript, in production, one day before the release? One of my team leaders, personally, performed this upgrade. Do you want to introduce, a new tool? Usually, not a problem, but then you are responsible for it. When I wanted to add Sinon.JS, I sent an email to the entire team to ask what they think. A few folks had some doubts (not about if, but about how). We called a quick meeting, and resolved all of them. Next time, when I wanted to add QUnit Parametrize, I just sent out a Code Review and email to entire team. No problems, everybody was ok with that. The only price I have to pay is helping others with issues related to these libraries. &quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot; :)\nI also remember when I wanted to make some change and asked a few people if I can do it. Nobody was sure, and somebody said: &quot;It&#39;s better to ask for forgiveness than for permission&quot; :)\nEven if you fail, or create something not perfect, people at Microsoft do not criticize very often saying: &quot;This sucks, that sucks&quot;. They know these words would create an expectation to propose better solution, or even implement it, and then - in the future - be responsible for every issue related to that. Instead, they say: &quot;what do you think about this alternative solution?&quot;, or &quot;let&#39;s take a look if we can do it better&quot;, or do not say anything.\nFrom development perspective, the most valuable lesson I learned was to avoid planning for one, big refactoring in the future (which usually you will never have time for), but instead perform small refactorings with every commit. I had also opportunity to observe the real value of tests in the project. Many times when somebody, or myself, were performing some change that &quot;there was no way it could impacted that functionality&quot;, and test was failing - it saved us from probably many long hours of debugging and investigating. I could also observed when after a few weeks we noticed something wasn&#39;t working from &quot;some time ago&quot;, and we didn&#39;t know what caused it because we didn&#39;t have tests. Every time when this happened we had to invest a lot of time to investigate and find the change that caused this (which is not easy in project where 40+ people contribute to one repository, and you have ~40 commits every day).\nCulture\nI have many friends who knows two things for sure:\n\neventually they will die\ncorporations are evil\n\nI was afraid of the second. Especially after reading the stories about Microsoft on the Internet that can be summarized like that:\n\nThe fact that there is enterprise overhead at Microsoft is true. It was nicely summarized by Eric Lippert in his blog post How many Microsoft employees does it take to change a lightbulb? However, now Microsoft is becoming a cool company again. The idea of One Microsoft is happening now. It feels like people are working towards the same goal. Last summer I participated in //oneweek hackathon where together with people from different teams across Microsoft we were hacking together, and it was great to be a hacker for a few days while being an engineer in everyday job (Hackers and Software Engineers). Recently I was at IoT meetup in Seattle, and one guy said: &quot;Microsoft was a wonderful company in 90&#39;, and then took a wrong direction in 2000&#39;, but now they are switching back. There is many interesting things happening at Microsoft now, and they are becoming cool again&quot;. Other people are starting notice this as well: link, link, link.\nThere is even a new, unofficial logo of the NEW Microsoft - Ninja Cat on Unicorn:\n\nI will say it again: there are many smart people working at Microsoft. What&#39;s more: higher in the hierarchy somebody is - he is a smarter person. This goes from my teammates, through our team leaders, all the way to Scott Guthrie and Satya. What is important when you work for some company, is to believe in your leadership team. I have no doubts that people like Scott Guthrie, Mark Russinovich or Satya know what they are doing. Additionally, every month there is Q&amp;amp;A session with Satya, where every employee can ask him a question. I wish I could quote some of Satya&#39;s answers here, because they are really valuable, and reasonable pieces of advice. You can find more about Microsoft under Satya in this article.\nLet&#39;s also talk about management at the lower level. Many people in Microsoft says &quot;my boss&quot;. I do not like calling my team leader like that, because I think he is more a leader than boss:\n\nI have 1 on 1 with him on every week. Usually 30 minutes, sometimes less or more, depends on the needs. During these meetings he is checking how I am doing, and how he can help me with any issues I have, and how he can enable me to utilize my full potential. He is doing the same for other 8 developers in the team, and in addition to that, he is doing as much development as others. His scrum update is not much different than the rest of us.\nAnother interesting thing at Microsoft is separate hierarchy for developers and program managers. As Joel Spolsky pointed out in this book - Joel on Software - there is a reason behind it. Instead of giving direct orders to developer, program manager has to convince developer that whatever he want him to implement make sense.\nWhat next?\nIt has been a great year. I had opportunity to work with amazing people, on a very interesting project, and I learned a lot.\nI am staying with the Azure Portal team. We have a lot of work to do. Especially, because Azure is growing exponentially. One year ago, when you clicked &#39;Browse&#39; on the portal, there was ~10 types of services on the list. Now, 1 year later, there is over 40 items on that list. This requires from us to enable other teams to develop at very fast pace using our framework. We keep improving the programming model, APIs, performance, and usability. There is also a lot of requests from users that we constantly monitor, and make happen (150/739 are fulfilled for today). We really appreciate your feedback!\nI am very excited about the future of the Azure Portal. From a developer point of view - it&#39;s a dream place to work. We are using the latest, greatest technologies. We are doing things that exercise browsers to such an extent that we are finding bugs in them, or have to fix/patch Open Source libraries that we are using. There is also a few features, I will be working on, that I am very excited about. Stay tuned!\nAdditionally, in upcoming months I will be speaking at a few conferences, and on October 31 there is the third edition of dotNetConfPL - online conference for .NET developers that I co-founded together with Michal Franc and Pawel Sawicz.\nI would like to say thank you for every member of my team. It&#39;s a pleasure to work with you, and be part of Microsoft in these days. I has never been a better time to work for Microsoft!\n"

    "content"  : "Last Thursday I had a pleasure to give talk about Speech Recognition in the Browser at the Code Fellows in Seattle.\n\n\n\nMany people were surprised how easy it is to add speech recognition to your website with pure JavaScript. So I thought I will share a few code snippets here. It works in Chrome only so far.\n\nRecognizing speech\n\nThis is how you can translate speech to text:\n\nvar sr = new webkitSpeechRecognition();\nsr.onresult = function (evt) {\n    console.log(evt.results[0][0].transcript);\n};\nsr.start();\n\nYou can also get the confidence level of the result:\n\nvar sr = new webkitSpeechRecognition();\nsr.onresult = function (evt) {\n    console.log(evt.results[0][0].transcript, evt.results[0][0].confidence);\n};\nsr.start();\n\nYou can get interim results:\n\nsr.interimResults = true;\t// false by default\nsr.onresult = function(evt) {\n\tfor (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; evt.results.length; ++i) {\n\t\tconsole.log(evt.results[i][0].transcript);\n\t};\n};\n\nOr different alternatives of recognized speech:\n\nsr.maxAlternatives = 10;\t// default = 1\nsr.onresult = function(evt) {\n\tfor (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; evt.results[0].length; ++i) {\n\t\tconsole.log(evt.results[0][i].transcript);\n\t}\n};\n\nYou can set a language, e.g., to Polish:\n\nsr.lang = &#39;pl-PL&#39;;\n\nAll above will stop recognition when you stop speaking. In order to do not stop recognition you need to set continuous flag to true. Additionally, this will treat every fragment of you speech as interim result, so you need to update onresult callback too:\n\nsr.continuous = true;\t// false by default\nsr.onresult = function(evt) {\n\tconsole.log(evt.results[evt.results.length-1][0].transcript);\n};\n\nSpeech Recognition object has other callbacks (than onresult) that you can take advantage of:\n\nsr.onstart = function() { console.log(&quot;onstart&quot;); };\nsr.onend = function() { console.log(&quot;onend&quot;); };\nsr.onspeechstart = function() { console.info(&quot;speech start&quot;); };\nsr.onspeechend = function() { console.info(&quot;speech end&quot;); };\n\nEmitting speech\n\nvar msg = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(&#39;Hi, I\\&#39;m Jakub!&#39;);\nspeechSynthesis.speak(msg);\n\nYou can also change the speaker voice:\n\nvar voices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices();\nmsg.voice = voices[10]; // Note: some voices don&#39;t support altering params\n\nThere is also other options you can set:\n\nmsg.volume = 1; // 0 to 1\nmsg.pitch = 2; //0 to 2\nmsg.text = &#39;Hello World&#39;;\nmsg.lang = &#39;en-US&#39;;\n\nmsg.onend = function(e) {\n\tconsole.log(&#39;Finished in &#39; + event.elapsedTime + &#39; seconds.&#39;);\n};\n\nSummary\n\nSpeech is coming to the browser, and you can not stop it. The question is when most of websites will add voice support. Check out voiceCmdr - a library that I blogged about earlier this year, which helps to add voice commands to your websites in very easy way. You can also check out website that can be navigated with voice commands - you can find available commands in my blog post. You can find entire logic for voice commands support in this file (lines: 38-103).\n"

    "content"  : "\nRecently I learned the hard way about setTimeouts side effects.\n101 setTimeout issue\nLet&#39;s say we have a following piece of code:\n\nvar someVar = 0;\n\nvar changeVar = function () {\n    someVar = 10;\n};\n\nAnd unit test:\n\nQUnit.asyncTest(&#39;should change variable to 10&#39;, function () {\n    // Arrange\n\n    someVar = 0;\n\n    // Act\n\n    changeVar();\n\n    // Assert\n\n    equals(someVar, 10);\n});\n\nOf course test passes, and we are happy.\nThen, after some time, because of a reason (e.g., we want to fix some bug), we are adding setTimeout to changeVar function:\n\nvar changeVar = function () {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        someVar = 10;\n    }, 10);\n};\n\nUnit test does not pass anymore. So we are adding setTimeout to our unit test as well (ideally: appropriately longer than one in changeVar function to avoid confusion!):\n\nQUnit.asyncTest(&#39;should change variable to 10&#39;, function () {\n    // Arrange\n\n    someVar = 0;\n\n    // Act\n\n    changeVar();\n\n    // Assert\n\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        equals(someVar, 10);\n    }, 20);\n});\n\nThen, we are introducing change to our code. Update only when someVar is not zero. We update function, and test accordingly:\n\nvar changeVar = function () {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        if (someVar !== 0) {\n            someVar = 10;\n        }\n    }, 10);\n};\n\nQUnit.asyncTest(&#39;should change variable to 10 if someVar != 0&#39;, function () {\n    // Arrange\n\n    someVar = 0;\n\n    // Act\n\n    changeVar();\n\n    // Assert\n\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        equal(someVar, 0);\n    }, 20);\n});\n\nEverything works. Great! Then, somebody else is fixing another bug - of course by increasing timeout:\n\nvar changeVar = function () {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        if (someVar !== 0) {\n            someVar = 10;\n        }\n    }, 50);\n};\n\nStill works, but when after some time we decide to change our logic:\n\nvar changeVar = function () {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        if (someVar === 0) {\n            someVar = 10;\n        }\n    }, 50);\n};\n\nOur test is still passing...when it shouldn&#39;t!\nOf course all of this is happening in large codebase with more complex logic.\nBut this is not that bad. Let&#39;s take a look at more interesting scenario.\nMore complex case\nWe are in worst situation when we have waterfall of setTimeouts.\n\nvar fun1 = function () {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        someVar++;\n    }, 10);\n};\n\nvar fun2 = function () {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        fun1();\n        someVar = 10;\n    }, 10);\n};\n\nGuess if this unit test will pass:\n\nQUnit.asyncTest(&#39;should change variable to 11&#39;, function() {\n    // Arrange\n\n    someVar = 0;\n\n    // Act\n\n    fun2();\n\n    // Assert\n\n    setTimeout(function () {\n    \tequal(someVar, 11);\n    \tstart();\n    }, 20);\n});\n\nYou think it should? You are wrong!\nBut this test will pass:\n\nQUnit.asyncTest(&#39;should change variable to 11&#39;, function() {\n    // Arrange\n\n    someVar = 0;\n\n    // Act\n\n    fun2();\n\n    // Assert\n\n    setTimeout(function () {\n    \tequal(someVar, 11);\n    \tstart();\n    }, 21);\n});\n\nDo you see the difference? Yes, timeout is 21 instead of 20. And of course everything will fall apart if somebody increase timeout in fun1 or fun2.\nSolution\nThe best solution is not to use setTimeout at all. Unfortunately we need async operations sometimes. In this case - you should use promises if possible. Unfortunately World is not perfect, especially Web Development World, and sometimes you have to use setTimeout (e.g., for UI effects etc.). You may think that if you set long enough timeout in your unit tests, everything should be good, right? Well...remember that it will make your unit tests slower. Instead - you should use polling approach.\nTo apply it to the last example - using &quot;Without Deferreds&quot; approach - copy poll function to your codebase:\n\nfunction poll(fn, callback, errback, timeout, interval) {\n    var endTime = Number(new Date()) + (timeout || 2000);\n    interval = interval || 100;\n\n    (function p() {\n            // If the condition is met, we&#39;re done! \n\n            if(fn()) {\n                callback();\n            }\n            // If the condition isn&#39;t met but the timeout hasn&#39;t elapsed, go again\n\n            else if (Number(new Date()) &amp;lt; endTime) {\n                setTimeout(p, interval);\n            }\n            // Didn&#39;t match and too much time, reject!\n\n            else {\n                errback(new Error(&#39;timed out for &#39; + fn + &#39;: &#39; + arguments));\n            }\n    })();\n}\n\nAnd call it in your unit test:\n\nQUnit.asyncTest(&#39;should change variable to 11&#39;, function() {\n    // Arrange\n\n    someVar = 0;\n\n    // Act\n\n    fun2();\n\n    // Assert\n\n    poll(\n\t    function() {\n\t        return someVar === 11;\n\t    },\n\t    function() {\n\t        ok(true);\n\t        start();\n\t    },\n\t    function() {\n\t        ok(false);\n\t        start();\n\t    }\n\t);\n});\n\nNow, you do not have to guess what value will be appropriate for setTimeout delay, and you will speed up your tests as well.\nWhen I see some strange behavior in code, the first thing I am looking at are setTimeout calls.\n"

Try it!\nFor a while I was wondering, where is a catch, but I didn&#39;t find any. This and that article confirms that Google Domains is a new serious player on the domains market.\nWhat domain registrar are you using?\n"

All Basecamp employees are remote workers. My key takeaways:\n\nworking remotely helps to better manage interruptions (nobody is going to step by with &quot;quick question&quot;)\nyou can manage your hours more flexibly: workout in the middle of the day? no problem\nyou live pretty much everywhere, and save up a lot of time on daily commute\n\nOf course authors present ideas that works for them, and may not necessary work for you. However, I am sure you will appreciate more than one of their advises.\nThis is one of my favorites quotes from Remote:\n\nAs a teaser you can watch Jason Fried&#39;s Ted talk: Why work doesn&#39;t happen at work. I also recommend David&#39;s talk: Unlearn Your MBA (from Stanford University).\nBoth Rework, and Remote goes to my favorite books list.\n"

    "content"  : "I got an opportunity to participate in Guest Speakers in Computer Science program as a guest speaker.\nThe goal is to connect students via Skype with people working in tech to solve one of the biggest talent problems in the world today. By 2020, it is estimated that one million computer science jobs in America will go unfilled because there are not enough students graduating with the right skills.\n\nWhat is amazing in Computer Science, in my opinion, is the opportunity to build things. It was about 10 years ago when I was in middle school, and I discovered that I can create a website that everybody in the World can see. Another great thing is the opportunity to solve other people&#39;s problems.\nI love my job, because it gives me different challenges every day. And it is not only about writing the code. Good Software Developer has to be also a good marketing person. He has to understand the market, and the customer needs. He has to know whether an application or feature he is working on is worth his effort, and whether this is what the customer needs.\nToday, Computer Science is not a single person coding in the basement. Nowadays, it is all about the people, cooperation and team effort. I love it, because I think that a group of people can always achieve more than a single person.\nComputer Science is hard. Sometimes you are spending hours debugging a nasty bug. You are getting more and more frustrated. But finally, once you solved the problem, you feel a lot of satisfaction. Especially because you did it! This is amazing in Computer Science. When you work hard, it always pays you back.\nI wanted be a part of Guest Speakers in Computer Science program, because I wanted to share my experience. I know how much it means for a person who want to start a career, to hear from somebody who already did it. I have been there, and I know how much the people who I met helped me to drive my career. I wanted to pay it back somehow.\nSo far I gave 4 talks, and it was very fun! The most common question was: &quot;Have you met Bill Gates?&quot;. This is something I need to work on :) There were also more practical questions like: &quot;what programming languages should I learn?&quot;, &quot;how to prepare for College if I want to study Computer Science?&quot;, or &quot;how to choose the right things to do out of millions possibilities?&quot;.\nIf you are IT professional I encourage you to join this program as well!\n"

    "content"  : "We all know that JavaScript has some bad parts. However, one of them is usually forgotten, and skipped in most of &quot;JavaScript Bad Parts&quot; lists on the Internet. It is a Date object. You can have hard time working with it, especially if you want to support time zones. In this post I would like to outline quircks of Date in JavaScript.\nBasics\nIn order to create a Date object, you just do:\n\nvar now = new Date();\n\nThis will create a date set to now.\nIf you want to create Date on specific day:\n\nvar year = 2015;\nvar month = 2-1; // February\nvar day = 27;\nvar now = new Date(year, month, day);\n\nHere you encounter the first quirk: months are numbered from 0 to 11. January is 0, December is 11.\nYou can also specify hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds as additional parameters (no more pitfalls here):\n\nvar year = 2015;\nvar month = 2-1; // February\nvar day = 27;\nvar hours = 14; // 2PM\nvar minutes = 56;\nvar seconds = 37;\nvar milliseconds = 997;\nvar now = new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds);\n\nFor more details about creating Date, check Date at MDN.\nFormatting\nIf you want to display a date, there are a few available converters. Here are the most commonly used:\n\nvar date = new Date(2015, 1, 27, 14, 56, 37, 997);\nconsole.log(date.toDateString());       // Fri Feb 27 2015\nconsole.log(date.toTimeString());       // 14:56:37 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleDateString()); // 2/27/2015\nconsole.log(date.toLocaleTimeString()); // 2:56:37 PM\nconsole.log(date.toUTCString());        // Fri, 27 Feb 2015 22:56:37 GMT\nconsole.log(date.toGMTString());        // Fri, 27 Feb 2015 22:56:37 GMT\nconsole.log(date.toISOString());        // 2015-02-27T22:56:37.997Z\nconsole.log(date.toJSON());             // 2015-02-27T22:56:37.997Z\n\nBe careful with 3 and 4. Both return different results, depended on user&#39;s machine settings and geographical location. This may cause UI issues (some date formats might be long).\nConverters 5 and 6 are equivalent in all, most popular browsers. However toGMTString is deprecated.\nConverters 7 and 8 are also equivalent. Moreover, toJSON use toISOString underneath to return result.\nThere is no significant issues with displaying Date, but there is no way to format it with custom format (e.g., &#39;YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm&#39;) like in C# or Java.\nAlternative for formatting is Intl.DateTimeFormat object from ECMAScript Internationalization API. However, this API is not yet supported by older browsers, most of mobile browsers, and Safari (check browser compatibility on MDN).\nParsing\nMore tricky than displaying dates, is parsing them. There are two common ways to parse date from string:\n\nvar parsedDate1 = new Date(&quot;2015-02-27 22:56:37&quot;);\nvar parsedDate2 = Date.parse(&quot;2015-02-27 22:56:37&quot;);\n\nFirst returns Date object, second - number 1425106597000 (milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).\nThere is one, very unpleasant detail in parsing:\nGiven a date string of &quot;March 7, 2014&quot;, parse() assumes a local time zone, but given an ISO format such as &quot;2014-03-07&quot; it will assume a time zone of UTC. Therefore Date objects produced using those strings will represent different moments in time unless the system is set with a local time zone of UTC. This means that two date strings that appear equivalent may result in two different values depending on the format of the string that is being converted (this behavior is changed in ECMAScript ed 6 so that both will be treated as local).\nSource: MDN\n\nThis means that date1 and date2 below (created from machine located in Seattle, WA) are different:\n\nvar date1 = new Date(&quot;2014-01-02&quot;);\nvar date2 = new Date(&quot;1/2/2014&quot;);\nconsole.log(date1); // Wed Jan 01 2014 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)\nconsole.log(date2); // Thu Jan 02 2014 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)\n\nRecommended format for parsing is: YYYY/MM/DD - user local settings independent. It always assumes local timezone offset for date string given as a parameter.\n\nvar date1 = new Date(&quot;2014/01/02&quot;);\nconsole.log(date1); // Thu Jan 02 2014 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)\n\nTimezones\nJavaScript Date object always assumes local timezone offset for the machine on which it is displayed. What is important: JavaScript Date does not support time zones, but only timezone offsets. This is a definition of both from Wikipedia:\nA time zone is a geographical region where just about everybody observes the same standard time.\nA time offset is an amount of time subtracted from or added to UTC to get the current civil time - whether it&#39;s standard time or Daylight saving time.\nIn other words: time zone is constant (as long as government does not changed it) for some place (e.g., San Francisco) all the time, while time zone offset changes (usually, twice a year - this is what we call &#39;daylight savings&#39;).\nTo get timezone offset:\n\nvar myDate = new Date();\nvar timezoneOffset = myDate.getTimezoneOffset(); // result in minutes\n\nThe result is in minutes. Here is another quirk: timezones that are &#39;west&#39; from UTC (offset = 0) have positive values (60 - 720), and timezones that are &#39;east&#39; from UTC have negative values (-60 - -780). Thus, Pacific Standard Time (UTC -8:00), in JavaScript, has timezone offset 480, and Central European Time (UTC +1:00) has timezone offset -60.\nOne more pitfall: local timezone offset is always set depends on value of Date object. Thus, for Computer located in Seattle, WA:\n\nvar date1 = new Date(2015,1,20); // date in Pacific Standard Time (before timezone offset change)\nvar date2 = new Date(2015,2,20); // date in Pacific Daylight Time (after timezone offset change)\nconsole.log(date1.getTimezoneOffset()); // 480\nconsole.log(date2.getTimezoneOffset()); // 420\n\nIn this case your current &#39;local&#39; timezone offset (for the time in which you are creating Date object) does not matter.\nEven if you create Date object with date before the time change, and then you modify it to date after the time change - its timezone offset changes to reflect offset for the new (current) value:\n\nvar date = new Date(2015,1,20); // date in Pacific Standard Time\nconsole.log(date.getTimezoneOffset()); // 480\ndate.setMonth(2); // change month so date is in Pacific Daylight Time now\nconsole.log(date.getTimezoneOffset()); // 420\n\nMoment.js\nMoment.js is a JavaScript library designed to work on the client side (in browser), and on the server side (in node.js). It has a lot of functions to parse, display and manipulate dates. This makes dealing with dates less painful.\nMoment Timezone - a library built on top of Moment.js - supports real time zones (not only timezone offsets). The data for Moment Timezone comes from the IANA Time Zone Database - most popular time zone database. New versions are released periodically as timezone laws change in various countries.\nConsider using Moment.js and Moment Timezone in your application when you are doing more complex operations with dates. Especially when you want to support time zones.\nSummary\nIt is really surprising that working with dates in programming is still causing a lot of issues. However, we are getting better at that. To get a comprehensive overview of date/time in programming language I recommend Date and Time Fundamentals by Matt Johnson. You can also check Matt Johnson&#39;s blog. He blogs mainly about date/time in variety of environments. His article JavaScript Date type is horribly broken might be good supplement for this post.\nTo get a quick insight why dealing with time zones is very complex, check this video. It is also worth to check What Every Programmer Should know about Time.\n"

    "content"  : "\nRecently I discovered Web Speech API. I was already talking to the browser using Google Hangout and Google Translator, but I have never thought about adding voice support to my own website.\nI did some research, and I found a demo. Based on that I put up simple demo website (say: &quot;show website blog&quot;, and it will take you directly to the sub page that can be also approached with 3 mouse clicks). For now speech recognition works only in Google Chrome and Safari. In Chrome it is not SpeechRecognition API, but webkitSpeechRegognition API. I hope, in the near future, other browsers will also implement it. Especially Spartan, which is integrated with Cortana.\nI noticed that while the API is flexible, it is not easy to use. I think, for most common scenarios, developer would like to be able to add commands associated with function callbacks, and control recognition state with start/stop actions.\nI created a JavaScript library voiceCmdr. It is a single .js file without any dependencies. You can install it with npm or bower (check README on github).\nYou can add commands:\n\nvoiceCmdr.addCommand(&quot;go home&quot;, function () {\n  // go to home page\n});\n\nCallback function can have parameter, which is everything you said after command. E.g.:\n\nvoiceCmdr.addCommand(&quot;search&quot;, function (param) {\n  // search for phrase specified in param\n});\n\nYou can also remove commands:\n\nvoiceCmdr.removeCommand(&quot;go home&quot;);\n\nIn order to start listening for commands:\n\nvoiceCmdr.start();\n\nTo stop listening:\n\nvoiceCmdr.stop();\n\nYou can also invoke listening for single command:\n\nvoiceCmdr.getCommand();\n\nCheck examples, and be aware that Web Speech API works only through http, and https (it will not work if you open static html file). The easiest way to run server is to use python SimpleHTTPServer:\n\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080\n\nThis can also go another way (by browser talking to you) with Web Synthesis API.\nI am curious what do you think. Are we ready for voice commands in the browser? Are you concerned about your privacy (check Scott Hanselman&#39;s tweet)?\n"

    "content"  : "I graduated last year, and I would like to summarize things I learnt. In the StackOverflow Podcast #36, Eric Sink said: \nThe best students learn Computer Science in class and programming on their own.\nI remember when back in days my friends from the University were talking about their first job, and 9/10 of them were saying something like that: &quot;During this one month Internship I learnt more than for 3 years in College&quot;. I couldn&#39;t say that about my job. At the beginning I thought that they probably got much better job or internship than me. It took me 3 years to understand this phenomena...and it wasn&#39;t phenomena. They thought, they learnt a lot, because they were able to get something done using some framework that did magic in the background (like creating simple CRUD web application with database configuring everything automatically). However, there is a lot of stuff between framework and hardware. I noticed, that lot of Developers don&#39;t care about it. Moreover, you can live without it. Like taxi driver doesn&#39;t need to know the city, as long as he has GPS. I think it is good to know the fundamentals.\nThere are some courses, which can help you to learn things, about which you probably will not bother once you get a job. In the same time, they are worth to learn, will help you to understand how computers work, and in my opinion will help in your future job.\nHere is my top 10 things/courses you should learn at University (which is the best time for it):\n\nComputer Architecture: to know how computer works, how they represent data (Two&#39;s complement system, IEEE 754). There are two books good books about that: Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach and The Elements of Computing Systems.\nCompilers: sort of supplement to computer architecture. It is connector between Software and Hardware. Classic book about compilers is Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (AKA Dragon Book).\nAlgorithms and Complexity (O notation): this is hard and challenging topic. Require a lot of practice, but pays off in the future. The bible for algorithms and computational complexity is Cormen&#39;s book: Introduction to Algorithms.\nAutomatas (DFA, NFA, Turing Machine, etc.): &quot;Recognizing the strings in a language is a formal way of expressing any problem&quot;. This is fundamental of Computer Science, as a Science, on top of which all software and hardware is built.\nAssembly Language: it helps to understand concurrent applications, and bugs occurring in them e.g. caused by instruction reorder.\nSystem programming: in the world of Cloud Computing and Virtual Machines, this is still useful subject that can gives you an insight into how software communicate with the hardware.\nEmbedded devices: the Internet of Things is the future. Additionally it is fun (check Jon Gallant blog post who joined Internet of Thing team at Microsoft).\nArtificial Intelligence: every year devices are more intelligent (from your phone, through medical devices to Google Car). According to Bill Gates AI will explode in next 10 years. University is great place to learn AI fundamentals.\nComputer Networks: it is good to learn about networks, how data is flowing in the wires (packets), what is DNS, CDN, what challenges, and limitations do we have in fast and reliable data exchange. Recommended book: Computer Networks (by A. Tanenbaum).\nComputer Security: everyone would like to be a hacker. First, you need to know the basics, and be aware that this topic is changing every year (sha1 is being replaced by sha2, because it is not &quot;secure enough&quot; anymore). Because it is changing so fast, there is no universal book that is up to date. However Practical Internet and Unix Security book is still very valuable. To be up to date with security issues, I strongly recommend you to follow Troy Hunt&#39;s blog (in my opinion: one of the best blogs in the Internet).\n\nOne can say: &quot;Turing Machine? Would I need it for something?...Probably not.&quot;. But again, I am talking about Computer Science, not programming. You can live without that knowledge, and do amazing things. Like mentioned taxi driver, who can take customers from place A to place B. But...what he will do, when GPS run out of battery or GPS will be wrong? What if there are two streets with the same name? Maybe GPS will indicate it, maybe not. Additionally, good taxi driver knows which way is faster, and where he will stuck in traffic on certain hours better than GPS.\nVery often we do not appreciate the knowledge gained at the University, but it helps us in everyday job in the same way like swimming and running helps the boxer in his fight.\nWhat is cool nowadays, you can learn Computer Science online for free.\nAt the end, it is totally up to you if you want to learn about Computer Science, or just learn how to program. I think it is good to know both. What do you think? Would you add/remove something to/from my top 10 list?\n"

    "content"  : "\nThe Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering is a classic book about software engineering, and project management. It was written 40 years ago, and most part of it is obsolete, but at the same time some parts are still valid.\nVery interesting observation made by the author is that Software project management is not much different than project management in other disciplines, because it is all about the people, their skills, communication, scheduling, and time estimation.\nBecause this book was written 40 years ago (based on the project accomplished 50 year ago!), most chapters describe Software Development based on waterfall methodology (the best way of making software at that time). Additionally, 40 years ago most of software was written in Assembler. Author mentions High-Level languages as possible future of Software Development. Besides that, I recommend this book. It shows that instead of 50 years past, we still have very similar problems (communication, error-prone software, estimation issues etc.), and we still struggle with finding &quot;The Silver Bullet&quot;.\nI recommend to read last 4 chapters first:\n\n16 - No Silver Bullet - Essence and Accident\n17 - &quot;No Silver Bullet&quot; Refired\n18 - Propositions of The Mythical Man-Month: True or False?\n19 - The Mythical Man-Month after 20 Years\n\nThis will give you an overview of &quot;no longer valid&quot; facts. Then start reading from the beginning, keeping in mind what is no longer true.\nChapters 1 and 2 are good introduction to this book, but (especially chapter 2) currently obsolete. Chapter 4 (Aristocracy, Democracy, and System Design) is still actual. Chapter 7 (Why Did the Tower of Babel Fail?) is about communication in Software Projects, and IMO still worth your attention.\nIn general I would recommend this book as a history lesson. Not necessary as a must-read book for programmers.\n"

    "content"  : "\nJust as natural pearls grow from grains of sand that have irritated oysters, these programming pearls have grown from real problems that have irritated real programmers.\nI just finished reading Jon Bentley&#39;s book: Programming Pearls. I read this book after Scott Hanselman&#39;s and Jeff Atwood&#39;s recommendations.\nThe problems analyzed in this book are still actual. However, I think that today programmers face slightly different challenges. Most of the problems described in this book are already solved in the libraries, or not often existing anymore (e.g., pretty printing on the console). I read the 2nd edition published in 1999, and most of problems require update to nowadays environments. For example: variable naming suggest the need to save the memory. E.g., l, u, x.\n[c]int binarysearch1(DataType t)\n{\tint l, u, m;\n\tl = 0;\n\tu = n-1;\n\tfor (;;) {\n\t\tif (l &amp;gt; u)\n\t\t\treturn -1;\n\t\tm = (l + u) / 2;\n\t\tif (x[m] &amp;lt; t)\n\t\t\tl = m+1;\n\t\telse if (x[m] == t)\n\t\t\treturn m;\n\t\telse /* x[m] &amp;gt; t */\n\t\t\tu = m-1;\n\t}\n}[/c]\nIn the interview (&quot;Epilog to second edition&quot;), the author argues that programming style he used should not be used in large software projects. Let&#39;s take this excuse.\nBook overview\nPart I is a set of useful, general advises how to tackle programming problems. One caveat: nowadays we use unit testing instead of assertions and &quot;scaffolding&quot; (described in chapter 5). However, it might be useful in some environments with some particular circumstances.\nPart II is about performance. Chapter 6 describe different optimization techniques. Although the tips are useful, today we are doing optimization on higher levels. I wonder if at least 1% of today programmers would be able to improve program performance, by rewriting assembly code. Anyway, this chapter shows that performance improvements can be done on different levels: algorithms, data structures, system architecture, underlying software, and even hardware. I like chapter 9, where author presents some very sophisticated tricks.\nPart III (Columns 11-15) is about algorithms. Although it shows interesting analysis and fundamental algorithms (for sorting, and searching), I would rather recommend some solid algorithms book (e.g. Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al).\nSummary\nProgramming Pearls shows which parts of software development changed, during last 15 years, but some parts of this book still remain valid. Moreover, this book is a good history lesson showing by example the advancement in software and hardware.\nThis book has many references to Steve McConnell&#39;s Code Complete, and The Mythical Man-Month. These books are on my to-read list for some time, and I will definitely read them in the near future.\n"

Both are not for beginners, but rather programmers who know some Object Oriented language (e.g., C#, Java or C++).\nJavaScript: The Good Parts\n\nWritten by the &quot;God Father of JavaScript&quot;: Douglas Crockford. This book is an overview of JavaScript language features that are different than in Object Oriented programming languages, such as C# or Java. Additionally, there is an overview of the good, and the bad parts of the language. What to avoid, and how. You can read it in a week (~200 pages).\nIn addition to JavaScript Good Parts, I recommend you to watch Crockford on JavaScript (mirror). You will learn not only about JavaScript, but also about the history of programming languages. There is also JavaScript the Good Parts course by Douglas Crockford on Pluralsight. This course is focused only on JavaScript though.\nEffective JavaScript: 68 Specific Ways to Harness the Power of JavaScript\n\nI like this book even better than &quot;The Good Parts&quot;. It contains very good examples that show specific aspects of the language. These examples combined with associated explanations makes this book clear and very informative for me. What I like especially was the structure: short 68 problems with explanation, analysis, and examples. Also, not very long (~200 pages). If you can choose only one of the books described in this post, read this one.\nOther JavaScript books\nI would be very happy to hear from you other JavaScript books that are worth (or not) reading. So far, besides mentioned books, I heard good things about:\n\nHigh Performance JavaScript by Nicholas Zakas\nEloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming by Marijn Haverbeke\nJavaScript Patterns by Stoyan Stefanov\nJavaScript: The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan\nLearning JavaScript Design Patterns by Addy Osmani\nSpeaking JavaScript by Axel Rauschmayer\n\nCan you recommend some of them?

    "content"  : "My Wordpress blog is hosted on Windows Azure, and I am using the only MySQL provider that is available on Azure: ClearDB.\nYesterday I couldn&#39;t log in to the admin panel. I had no idea what was going on, because blog was working. I was googling for cause/solution, checking Azure logs, monitoring on Azure Portal, and accidentally I noticed that I exceeded ClearDB quota (20 MB). I did not receive any notifications from ClearDB though. What is important: if you exceed this limit, they block INSERT and UPDATE operations. My guess is that Wordpress is probably trying to INSERT/UPDATE something in database when you log in. That&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t log in.\nI did not want to upgrade from free instance to $9.99/month (the cheapest upgrade option). Fortunately I was able to connect with database using MySQL Workbench, and optimize my database.\nI removed post revisions:\n[sql]DELETE FROM wp_posts WHERE post_type = &amp;quot;revision&amp;quot;;[/sql]\nAnd transients:\n[sql]DELETE FROM wp_options WHERE option_name LIKE (&#39;%\\_transient\\_%&#39;)[/sql]\nThis allowed me to save a lot of space. From 20.28 MB, the database size went to 10.42 MB (transients occupied almost 8MB!):\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter I did that, I was able to log in. However, INSERT/UPDATE lock is not revoked immediately. I had to wait something between 10 minutes and 2 hours. I went to the swimming pool in meantime, thus I am not sure how much exactly it take.\nUseful SQL command to check you database size:\n[sql]SELECT SUM(round(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2)) &amp;quot;Size in MB&amp;quot;\nFROM information_schema.TABLES\nWHERE table_schema = &#39;$DB_NAME&#39;\nORDER BY (data_length + index_length) DESC;[/sql]\nYou can also check each table size:\n[sql]SELECT table_name AS &amp;quot;Tables&amp;quot;,\nround(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) &amp;quot;Size in MB&amp;quot;\nFROM information_schema.TABLES\nWHERE table_schema = &#39;$DB_NAME&#39;\nORDER BY (data_length + index_length) DESC;[/sql]\nFor the future, I pinned the database size tile to my Azure Portal dashboard. Now, I will be able to see it every time I am visiting the portal. I also limited the number of post/pages revisions to 2, by editing wp-config.php file, and inserting this line:\n[php]define(&#39;WP_POST_REVISIONS&#39;, 2);[/php]\nThis should be enough to not exceed the quota for some time, but I will need some permanent solution. I am thinking about hosting my own MySQL database on LinuxVM, on Azure (cost: $13+).\nDuring the troubleshooting I found very good blog post by John Papa: Tips for WordPress on Azure. I recommend you to check this out if you have a Wordpress blog on Azure. This article will help you to optimize your Wordpress database as well.\nEDIT: The plugin Optimize Database after Deleting Revisions allow to clean up database even more efficient. I managed to slim my DB down by another 50%, to 4.11., which gives almost 80% size decrease from the original 20+ MB.\n\nWhat is even more cool about this plugin, you can create a schedule to run it automatically (Settings -&amp;gt; Optimize DB options):\n\n"

    "content"  : "\nGulp is a streaming build system (aka task runner). It contains plugins, which allows you to run tasks such as TypeScript to JavaScript compilation, Less to CSS compilation, bundling, minification, running you own scripts, and much, much more.\nInstallation\nRequired: npm (Node Packaged Modules). You can install it with Chocolatey:\ncinst nodejs\nWhen you have npm, you are good to go and install Gulp:\nnpm install -g gulp\nAfter installation, localize &quot;gulp.cmd&quot; file, and add its location to your PATH. Location depends on the way how you installed nodejs. On my one machine, where I installed nodejs using the installer, it is in C:\\Users\\jjed\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm directory. On my other machine, where I installed nodejs from Chocolatey, it is in C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\lib\\nodejs.commandline.0.10.31\\tools. I recommend you Everything Search Engine not only for this task, but for searching all kind of files on your machine. It is ridiculously fast, and when you pin it to your task bar as the first item, you can invoke it with WIN+1.\nI wish npm installation did this work (adding gulp to PATH) automatically.\nGulp Hello World\nOpen the Console (I recommend ConEmu as you Console on Windows), and cd into your project directory (for now it can be even empty directory).\nFrom your project root directory run:\nnpm install --save-dev gulp\nCreate gulpfile.js file in the root of your project:\n\nvar gulp = require(&#39;gulp&#39;);\n\ngulp.task(&#39;default&#39;, function () {\n  console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);\n});\n\nRun gulp:\ngulp\nYou should see the following result (with different time stamps and path, probably):\n[21:45:32] Using gulpfile C:\\dev\\myproj\\gulpfile.js\n[21:45:32] Starting &#39;default&#39;...\nHello, world!\n[21:45:32] Finished &#39;default&#39; after 141 µs\nThe default task is invoked when you run gulp.js without any arguments. You can run other tasks from default task. Below file contains hello task, and invoke it from the default task:\n\nvar gulp = require(&#39;gulp&#39;);\n\ngulp.task(&#39;hello&#39;, function () {\n  console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);\n});\n\ngulp.task(&#39;default&#39;, [&#39;hello&#39;]);\n\nThe result of gulp run is a little bit different now:\n[21:49:21] Using gulpfile C:\\dev\\myproj\\gulpfile.js\n[21:49:21] Starting &#39;hello&#39;...\nHello, world!\n[21:49:21] Finished &#39;hello&#39; after 210 µs\n[21:49:21] Starting &#39;default&#39;...\n[21:49:21] Finished &#39;default&#39; after 8.21 µs\nUsing Gulp to compile TypeScript files &#39;on change&#39;\nInstall TypeScript (if you do not have it installed already):\nnpm install -g typescript\nMake sure tsc is in your path.\nInstall TypeScript compiler for gulp.js (from your project root directory):\nnpm install --save-dev gulp-tsc\nCreate TypeScript directory, and cd into it:\nmkdir TypeScript\ncd TypeScript\nCreate simple hello.ts file:\n\nfunction greeter(person: string) {\n    return &quot;Hello, &quot; + person;\n}\n\nvar user = &quot;Anders Hejlsberg&quot;;\n\nconsole.log(greeter(user));\n\nGo to root directory of your project and create js directory (it will be output directory for generated JavaScript files):\nmkdir js\nModify gulpfile.js:\n\nvar gulp = require(&#39;gulp&#39;),\n\ttypescript = require(&#39;gulp-tsc&#39;);\n\ngulp.task(&#39;typescript-compile&#39;, function(){\n  return gulp.src([&#39;TypeScript/*.ts&#39;])\n    .pipe(typescript())\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(&#39;js/&#39;));\n});\n\ngulp.task(&#39;watch&#39;, function () {\n  gulp.watch(&#39;TypeScript/*.ts&#39;, [&#39;typescript-compile&#39;]);\n});\n\ngulp.task(&#39;default&#39;, [&#39;typescript-compile&#39;, &#39;watch&#39;]);\n\nOnce you run gulp it will compile all TypeScript files from TypeScript directory to js directory. Furthermore, Gulp will not suspend, but it will watch all .ts files under TypeScript directory, and will recompile them every time you change and save some of them. Try it!\nPrevent gulp.js from crashing by handling errors\nYou can notice that if some of your TypeScript files cause compilation error (e.g., because of syntax error) then gulp crashes.\nIn order to avoid it, you can add simple error handling function (errorLog) to gulp.js file, and call it in the typescript-compile task pipeline:\n\nvar gulp = require(&#39;gulp&#39;),\n\ttypescript = require(&#39;gulp-tsc&#39;);\n\nfunction errorLog (error) {\n  console.error.bind(error);\n  this.emit(&#39;end&#39;);\n}\n\ngulp.task(&#39;typescript-compile&#39;, function(){\n  return gulp.src([&#39;TypeScript/*.ts&#39;])\n    .pipe(typescript())\n    .on(&#39;error&#39;, errorLog)\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(&#39;js/&#39;));\n});\n\ngulp.task(&#39;watch&#39;, function () {\n  gulp.watch(&#39;TypeScript/*.ts&#39;, [&#39;typescript-compile&#39;]);\n});\n\ngulp.task(&#39;default&#39;, [&#39;typescript-compile&#39;, &#39;watch&#39;]);\n\nNow, Gulp will not crash, but display compilation error, and recompile files after next file change.\nUsing gulp.js to run batch/bash script\nLet assume that you want to run some script (batch file on Windows, or bash script on Unix) after TypeScript files compilation.\nFirst, we need to install gulp-shell plugin:\nnpm install gulp-shell\nTo keep it simple, our script will only output text &quot;TypeScript compilation done&quot; to the console.\nCreate file build.cmd in your project root directory:\n\necho &quot;TypeScript compilation done&quot;\n\nAnd modify gulpfile.js:\n\nvar gulp = require(&#39;gulp&#39;),\n  run = require(&#39;gulp-shell&#39;),\n  typescript = require(&#39;gulp-tsc&#39;);\n\nfunction errorLog (error) {\n  console.error.bind(error);\n  this.emit(&#39;end&#39;);\n}\n\ngulp.task(&#39;typescript-compile&#39;, function(){\n  return gulp.src([&#39;TypeScript/*.ts&#39;])\n    .pipe(typescript())\n    .on(&#39;error&#39;, errorLog)\n    .pipe(gulp.dest(&#39;js/&#39;))\n    .pipe(shell([&#39;build.cmd&#39;]));\n});\n\ngulp.task(&#39;watch&#39;, function () {\n  gulp.watch(&#39;TypeScript/*.ts&#39;, [&#39;typescript-compile&#39;]);\n});\n\ngulp.task(&#39;default&#39;, [&#39;typescript-compile&#39;, &#39;watch&#39;]);\n\nIn real-life you may want to copy all compiled files to some other directory, or do some other &quot;your project specific&quot; task.\nUsing gulp-shell you can run any command, or set of commands (concatenating them with &#39;&amp;amp;&#39; on Windows, or &#39;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&#39; on Unix), e.g.:\nshell([&#39;cd c:/dev/myproj/src &amp;amp; build&#39;]);\nSummary\nGulp is very handful tool. However it is not the only one. Its main rival is Grunt.js. Actually, Gulp was inspired by Grunt. Most of people (based on my research) prefer Gulp over Grunt. Main argument: it allows to stream results (run multiple operations on set of files), and it is less verbose (allows to do more with less configuration). Check Grunt vs Gulp comparison in this blog post, and this Steve Sanderson&#39;s talk (starting from 30:50).\nTo get more of Gulp check Getting Started With Gulp, Learning Gulp, and gulp documentation.\nAre you using Gulp or Grunt, or some other task runner?\nEDIT: I updated the post with return statements in tasks. This informs task system that particular task is async, and prevents from occasional crashes when called from watch task.\n"

In my imagination it looks like that:\n\nI thought it would be cool to create one, and play with it for a while.

And using D14 for an hour cost only ~1 Euro.\nWhen I was wondering which OS install on the VM I found that Azure already offers Windows 10 preview VM:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nThis is how it looks after installation:\n\nWorking on this VM was even better (faster) than on my PC at work (Xeon with 6 cores and 32GB RAM). To stress the VM I opened over 100 instances of Visual Studio:\n\nAfter opening 90 instances the VM slowed down. I opened 103 Visual Studios in total, and VM didn&#39;t crash.\nThis feeling of having the most powerful machine I have ever work on is amazing. Even though it is virtual. The most amazing thing is the fact that it cost me only 1 Euro to play with it for an hour. I can get it in a few minutes, and get rid of it within seconds.\nI am using it from time to time as my playground, and scale-up/down according to my needs.\nLater in this year, the G-series of VMs will be available on Azure. The biggest in this series would be G5: 32 Cores + 448 GB RAM. That&#39;s gonna be...awesome!\n\n"

    "content"  : "The second edition of dotNetConfPL was pretty successful. I am very pleased with all sessions, and speakers performance.\nAll sessions went smooth, but one. Barbara Fusinska could not run screenshare on Google Hangouts. Her session was recorded later and is already available. The only way to inform other about the problems during the conference was through JabbR or displaying Blue Screen of Death instead of her session. Adding something on website would require us to redeploy. We didn&#39;t want to do that. For the next year we will prepare some placeholder for information, which can be set dynamically.\nThis year we had one non-technical talk: Talent for $2. You would be tempted to! I think this talk has great potential. It includes a lot of pointers and tips. I encourage you to look at it. I watched Simon Sinek&#39;s TED talk: &quot;How great leaders inspire action&quot;, and I took Clifton&#39;s test to discover my talents. My 5 talents are:\n\nLearner\nFocus\nResponsibility\nDeliberative\nAnalytical\n\nI am very interested if some of you did this test, and what results did you get.

    "content"  : "\nAfter I got my degree in August I moved to Redmond, WA to start my new job at Microsoft. I work for Azure App Platform Team. My official position is Software Development Engineer (SDE).\nIt has been a month since I started. So far, my team, work environment, the product and development process are great.\nMy team\n\nMy team (which is part of Azure App Platform) is working on the new Azure Portal. People in my team are smart. All of them. Moreover, they are really passionate about things they are doing, and they really care. I am working with Steve Sanderson, the creator of Knockout.js and one of the best technical speakers. The team is very diverse: people from many different countries all around the World, with a quite few girls among them.\nMy team is working in Agile.  The working culture is generally: &quot;Get the job done&quot;. People are in the office usually between 10am and 5pm. Some are coming later, and stay longer, others come early and leave early (there are also people who come early and leave late). If somebody feel the need to focus and don&#39;t being interrupted then he/she is working from home, and it is not a problem.\nWhat is the best, I am not implementing some spec written by somebody 5 levels above me. I need to implement an idea, add my contribution, suggest changes etc. When I asked a question what are the expectations from me, my lead and my manager told me that they expect me to suggest some ideas how to make the product better, how we can improve it, and what we are doing wrong. This is exactly what I was looking forward to!\nWork environment\n\nThe building I am working in (Microsoft Building 44) is designed for Agile interactions. There are white boards everywhere. We work in Open Spaces (around 15 people per room). Microsoft is changing approach, and moving from private offices/cubicles to open spaces. What is cool, there are 3 conference rooms &#39;attached&#39; to our Open Space (2 small, 1 big), and if somebody needs to work in peace, he/she can use one of them. If all are occupied (which does not happen very often), there are special &#39;focus rooms&#39; (with desk and chair) in the building.\nI have great machines to work on: HP Workstation Z420 (Xeon E5-1650 v2 3.5 GHz, 32 GB RAM, 128 GB SSD + 256 GB SSD + 1 TB SATA) with two 24&quot; monitors DELL Ultrasharp U2415, and Microsoft Sculpt keyboard and mouse. I have also ultrabook Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon (i7-3667U @ 2 GHz, 8 GB RAM, 240 GB SSD). I have adjustable height desk, and very comfortable Haworth Zody Task chair.\nThe product\n\nThe new Azure portal is a Single Page Metro Web Application. One of the main goals of the new portal is to make it easy for adding extensions. My team is working on the Framework, which is being used by other teams to create front-end for underlying Azure infrastructure. What is cool,  every extension is working as a standalone application in a separate iframe. Extension authors do not need to work with HTML and CSS a lot. They just use controls (e.g. list, combo box or checkbox) created by us, and communicate with them through TypeScript/JavaScript. Update of the view is performed by Knockout.js. Check Justin Beckwith&#39;s post about the new Azure portal architecture. If you have not seen it yet, check the Overview of the new Azure Portal with Vishal Joshi and Scott Hanselman and Vishal and Scott create a new startup with the new Azure Portal. To get started with Azure, check my previous post, and get a free trial. Moreover, we need (and we appreciate) your feedback!\nTechnologies\n\n \nWe use HTML5 and LESS for our View layer. LESS is very handy in maintaining big style sheets.\nWe use TypeScript (which compiles to JavaScript). Strong typing, and abstraction over JavaScript inheritance (TypeScript classes) is very, very helpful in building large-scale application. To be honest, I do not know how we would be able to maintain the new Azure Portal using raw JavaScript.\nOur main JavaScript Framework is Knockout.js. This allows us to prepare generic, reusable controls that can be used by other teams without the need of interaction with the DOM.\nOur unit test framework is QUnit. For integration tests we use Selenium.\nWe use git for source control management. As Continuous Integration Server, we use Jenkins.\nWe have code review process supported by CodeFlow. It is required to have at least 2 reviews before code can be checked-in/pushed to the repository.\nBuilding process is supported by MSBuild.\nBehind the scenes, we use bunch of other JS libs, e.g. q.js, inject.js, d3.js, hammer.js or ZeroClipboard.js.\nSummary\nAfter 1 month I love it! There are many challenges, and interesting problems to solve. I am still new to the project, and I didn&#39;t discover it entirely yet. What I can say now, I really like the people from my team, the software development process and work environment in my team.\nProbably I will be writing about my work on this blog. Stay tuned!\n\n"

    "content"  : "This post is part of the series: iOS for C# Developer. Previous parts:\n\npart 1 (Classes and creating objects)\npart 2 (strings)\npart 3 (multithreading)\n\nC# developers works with Visual Studio. Recently, some are trying to switch to SublimeText. However, I will assume that you, as C# Developer are familiar with VS. To write iOS applications, you need Xcode. I haven&#39;t heard about nobody who created an working app in a different editor (more advanced than Hello World).\nIn this post I would like to provide a few tips that will help you to get started and be productive.\nThe first thing that is worth to mention is the fact that Xcode is free. You cannot test you apps on the iPhone or iPad before you pay $99 though. You need to be satisfied with simulator.\nKey shortcuts\nFor the beginning, remember three:\n\n⇧ + ⌘ + O - quick open (equivalent to CTRL+, in VS2013 or CTRL+T in ReSharper)\n⌥ + click - jump to documentation (when clicked on class/interface)\n⌘ + L - jump to specified line of code\n\nThis three will definitely help you to get productive at the beginning. You can find more in this cheat-sheet.\nDebugging\nIn order to debug application in VS, you have to run it in debug mode. In Xcode, when you run the app on emulator it is always in debug mode. Thus, you just need to set the break-point (by mouse click on the line number, like in VS, or by ⌘ + \\ shortcut) and run the app (⌘ + R). Once break-point is reached you can step over (F6), step into (F7) or step out (F8).\nVery useful during debugging is dumping objects into console with NSLog function:\nNSLog(jsonString);\nThis outputs, e.g., JSON string to the console, which allows you to inspect it.\nTo get more flavor of debugging, check Apple documentation and Brian Moakley&#39;s blog post.\nPlaygrounds\nThe latest version of Xcode (v6), which introduce support for Swift language, adds also very handy feature: Playgrounds. It allows you write and test simple Swift programs, without using iOS emulator. Playgrounds are useful especially, when you are testing some complex logic. They are very powerful. You can use them even to test drawing (still without running iOS emulator). To see it in action, check this demo.\nSummary\nXcode is very nice IDE. Works very smooth, and breaks very rarely. I wish there was more code snippets (like it is in Visual Studio, especially with ReSharper or WebEssentials). Xcode could also adapt rich debugging experience from VS (e.g., inspecting object variable after moving mouse pointer in top of them). I find it hard to work with this IDE on small screen (like MacBook display). To get comfortable, I need at least 22-24&quot;. But that is just my opinion. What do you think?\n"

    "content"  : "This post is part of the series: iOS for C# Developer. Previous parts:\n\npart 1 (Classes and creating objects)\npart 2 (strings)\n\nThe most typical scenario to use multithreading is to maintain responsive UI when we do some resource-consuming computation.\nC#\nLet&#39;s consider simple button click action in C#:\nprivate void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    this.status.Content = &quot;Computing...&quot;;\n    Compute();\n    this.status.Content = &quot;Done&quot;;\n}\n\nprivate void Compute()\n{\n    Thread.Sleep(5000);            \n}\n\nMethod Compute() is a CPU-intensive operation (simulated by Sleep() function).\nAbove code will block UI during computation. To keep UI responsive, computation has to take place in a separate thread. It can be done easily using async/await keywords:\nprivate async void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    this.status.Content = &quot;Computing...&quot;;\n    await Compute();\n    this.status.Content = &quot;Done&quot;;\n}\n\nprivate async Task Compute()\n{\n    await Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&amp;gt;\n    {\n        Thread.Sleep(5000);\n    });\n}\n\niOS\nThis is equivalent (single-threaded) button click handler in iOS:\n- (IBAction)buttonClick:(id)sender\n{\n    self.status.text = @&quot;Computing...&quot;;\n    [self compute];\n    self.status.text = @&quot;Done&quot;;\n}\n\n- (void)compute\n{\n    [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:5];\n}\n\nMultithreaded version is a little bit different. In Objective-C, there is no syntax similar to async/await. Thus, status update has to be invoked by background thread explicitly. Additionally, every UI operation (in this case: label text update) has to be done in the main thread. Below code, use Dispatch Queues, which is the easiest and recommended way for multithreading scenarios:\n- (IBAction)buttonClick:(id)sender\n{\n    self.status.text = @&quot;Computing...&quot;;\n    [self compute];\n}\n\n- (void)compute\n{\n    dispatch_queue_t queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0);\n    dispatch_async(queue, ^{\n        [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:5];\n        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{\n            self.status.text = @&quot;Done&quot;;\n        });\n    });\n}\n\nThis multithreaded code will look pretty similar in Swift.\nSummary\nInvoking background threads is much easier from developer perspective in C#. Code is concise and more readable. Multithreading in Objective-C introduce some overhead, but it is not very hard to handle.\n"

    "content"  : "This post is part of the series: iOS for C# Developer. First part can be found here.\nString operations in Objective-C are very verbose in comparison to C#.\nLet&#39;s assume the following string definition for all below examples:\nNSString *str = @&quot;Some string. Another string.&quot;;\nConcatenation\nI think this is the most common operation. In C# it is very simple:\nstring result += &quot; Appended string.&quot;;\n* For concatenation in C#, consider using StringBuilder class (if performance matters).\nIn Objective-C, NSMutableString type has to be used. Thus, if we have NSString created, we have to do the following:\nNSMutableString *temp = [[NSMutableString alloc] initWithString:str];\n[temp stringByAppendingString:@&quot; Appended string.&quot;];\nstr = temp;\nA bit of work, huh?\nSubstring\nTo get substring from letter 3 to 7 in C#:\nstring result = str.Substring(3,5);\nIn Objective-C:\nNSString *result = [str substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(3,5)];\nPretty straightforward.\nSplit\nTo split sentences in our sample string in C#, we would do:\nstring[] result = str.Split(&quot;. &quot;);\nIn Objective-C:\nNSArray *result = [str componentsSeparatedByString:@&quot;. &quot;];\nAlso, pretty similar.\nReplace\nThis operation is much more verbose than its equivalent in C#. To replace spaces with underscores, in C# we do:\nstring result = str.Replace(&quot; &quot;, &quot;_&quot;);\nIn Objective-C:\nNSString *result = [str stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@&quot; &quot; withString:@&quot;_&quot;];\nLooks pretty the same, but long, custom names preceding actual parameters make code unnecessary long (IMO).\nReal-world example\nUsually we need a few string operations working together. Let&#39;s apply above operations together. For example: we want to get only the second sentence from our string with underscores instead of spaces.\nIn C#:\nstring result = str.Split(new [] {&quot;. &quot;}, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries)[1].Replace(&#39; &#39;,&#39;_&#39;);\nIn Objective-C:\nNSString *result = [[str componentsSeparatedByString:@&quot;. &quot;][1] stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@&quot; &quot; withString:@&quot;_&quot;];\nSummary\nSome of above operations are easier in Swift (e.g., concatenation looks the same like in C#), but some are still very verbose (e.g., substring, replace). However, the syntax is more similar to C#. The message passing syntax is something you need to get use to in Objective-C, not only in case of string operations.\n"

    "content"  : "In this series I would like to present an overview of differences and similarities in developing iOS and C# apps.\nFirst part is about Object-Oriented features. If you are C# developer and you are starting with Objective-C, Object-Oriented terminology might be confusing.\nInterface\nIn Objective-C, interface is a class declaration (not existing in C#). It is like header file in C++. It has even the same extension: .h. This is sample interface:\n@interface Example\n\n+ (void)someStaticMethod;\n\n- (NSInteger)someInstanceMethod:(BOOL)param1 calledWith:(NSInteger)num;\n\n@end\n\nStatic (class) methods are distinguished by + sign. Instance method starts with - sign. Return types are in brackets. Parameters (brackets and name) are preceded by custom name. In class implementation only parameter name matters.\nImplementation\nIn addition to interface (equivalent of class declaration), Objective-C classes have also implementation files with .m extension (equivalent of .cpp files in C++). Example implementation for previous interface (class declaration) can look like that:\n@implementation Example\n\n+ (void)someStaticMethod\n{\n  // implementation\n}\n\n- (NSInteger)someInstanceMethod:(BOOL)param1 calledWith:(NSInteger)num\n{\n  if(param1) {\n    return num*2;\n  } else {\n    return num;\n  }\n}\n\n@end\n\nProtocols\nProtocol is equivalent of interface in C#. This is sample protocol definition:\n@protocol SampleProtocol\n- (void)protocolMethod1;\n- (void)protocolMethod2;\n@end\n\nTo take advantage of this protocol in some class, it has to be stated in angled brackets, in the interface definition:\n@interface Example : NSObject \n+ (void)someStaticMethod;\n- (NSInteger)someInstanceMethod:(BOOL)param1 calledWith:(NSInteger)num;\n@end\n\nThen, its methods have to be implemented in the implementation file:\n@implementation Example \n\n+ (void)someStaticMethod \n{ \n  // implementation \n} \n\n- (NSInteger)someInstanceMethod:(BOOL)param1 calledWith:(NSInteger)num \n{ \n  if(param1) { \n    return num*2; \n  } else { \n    return num; \n  } \n} \n\n- (void)protocolMethod1 \n{ \n  // implementation \n} \n\n- (void)protocolMethod2 \n{ \n  // implementation \n} \n\n@end\n\nThere are two types of methods in protocol:\n\nrequired (default)\noptional\n\nIn previous protocol, both methods are required, because it is a default mode. This means, both has to be implemented in the class that use the protocol. In order to make second method optional, keyword @optional has to be used:\n@protocol SampleProtocol\n\n- (void)protocolMethod1;\n\n@optional\n- (void)protocolMethod2;\n\n@end\n\nAll methods declared after @optional keyword are optional. In order to declare required method after that, @required keyword has to be used:\n@protocol SampleProtocol\n\n- (void)protocolMethod1;  // required method\n\n@optional\n- (void)protocolMethod2;  // optional method\n- (void)protocolMethod3;  // optional method\n\n@required\n- (void)protocolMethod4;  // required method\n\n@end\n\nInstantiating objects\nCreating instance of object has two steps: allocation and initialization. To create instance of Example class defined above, message passing syntax is used:\nExample *obj = [[Example alloc] init];\nShortcut for above object creation:\nExample *obj = [Example new];\nWhen the class has a constructor with parameters, e.g.:\n@interface Example : NSObject {\n  NSInteger *sampleProperty;\n}\n- (id) initWithParam:param;\n@end\n\n@implementation Example\n\n- (id) initWithParam:(NSInteger)param\n{\n  self = [super init];\n  if (self) {\n    self.sampleProperty = param;\n  }\n  return self;\n}\n\n@end\nInitialization looks as follows:\nExample *obj = [Example initWithParam:25];\nSummary\n\nInterface - class declaration\nImplementation - class body (implementation of declared methods in class interface)\nProtocol - the same construct as interface in C#\nObject creation: Example *obj = [[Example alloc] init];\n\n"

I created PCA Pump Prototype for BeagleBoard-xM platform, by translating already existing models (using translations developed by me), and performed verification (static analysis) using SPARK Verification Tools.\nThis is a video from my defense:\n\nUnfortunately, QuickTime crashed 3 minutes before the end. Fortunately, you can catch up with slides.\nI created additional video with PCA Pump Prototype demonstration. Pump is developed in SPARK Ada, and it runs on BeagleBoard-xM platform.\nPatient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump is a medical device, which allows the patient to self-administer small doses of narcotics (usually Morphine, Dilaudid, Demerol, or Fentanyl). PCA pumps are commonly used after surgery to provide a more effective method of pain control than periodic injections of narcotics. A continuous infusion (called a basal rate) permits the patient to receive a continuous infusion of pain medication. Patient can also request additional boluses, but only in specified intervals. It prevents from overinfusion. In addition to basal and patient bolus, clinician can also request bolus called clinician bolus or square bolus.\n\nMy Master Thesis in PDF format can be found here. LaTeX source is available here.\nI spent 2 years at Kansas State University (4 months as an Exchange Student, and 20 months as a Graduate Student). I had very good time and I learnt a lot. I really recommend to get Master degree from a different University than you get your Bachelor. Wroclaw University of Technology (where I got my Bachelor) is more practical. Graduates are ready to work at the industry. Kansas State is more theoretical and research oriented. I had an opportunity to experience both and I am very happy with that!\n"

Furthermore, it is worth to read it from the beginning to the end, to understand how C# works and to get familiar with the language features (can be used in the future as a reference).

Now, I know about them and where to look if needed.\nThis book is rather for experienced C# programmers. I do not recommend it as &quot;first C# book&quot;. It has a lot of examples, but the structure is rather encyclopedia style, than discovering the language from the basics. For beginner I would recommend Sams Teach Yourself Visual C# 2010 in 24 Hours.\nC# in Nutshell has 1064 pages! Although it takes a while to read, it is worth your time if you think seriously about becoming good C# programmer. There are very detailed overviews and analysis of the language, supported by examples. If you do not want to spend time reading entire book, I recommend to use it as a reference and start learning about concrete feature, which you need at the time, from specific chapter in this book.\n\n"

    "content"  : "\nFinally, I had time to watch Build 2014 sessions. Here are the best I have seen.\nThinking for programmers (Leslie Lamport)\nThis session is intersection of Computer Science and programming. It will really makes you rethink your approach for solving problems and writing code. One of many interesting thoughts mentioned by Leslie Lamport was a role of specification. It is hard to disagree that in case of very complex code, need for change, after a few months or years, or by other programmer, will cause rewriting code for scratch if we do not have specification. I am recommending this session, because it is not demo of some new Microsoft tool/technology, but a solid piece of knowledge. It is not session for everybody, some may not like it. I love it!\nWindows and the Internet of Things (Steve Teixeira)\nThis session is about writing Software for devices. But not only for PC, tablet or Phone. Also for embedded devices, or customized devices running on Windows Embedded. It is an overview of the future. Not only in Windows World, but at all. Steve Teixeira shows cool demos. E.g. controlling traffic lights using the Phone. He presents Intel Galileo, board which you can get for free by signing up! Only limited number available.\nBuilding Azure Web Sites with Visual Studio Online “Monaco” (Chris Dias)\nVisual Studio in Web Browser? I&#39;m in! I am very impressed with progress which is being made in online version of Visual Studio. In addition to simple edits, there is a command line access, intellisense, git integration, side by side file comparison and more.\nWhat&#39;s New for ASP.NET and Web in Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 and Beyond (Scott Hanselman and Scott Hunter)\nThis is an update of ASP.NET features and future directions. Now, it really starts looking like LEGO pieces. If you are Web Developer, definitely worth to see.\nModern C++: What You Need to Know (Herb Sutter)\nThis talk is an overview of new features of C++. There is also 10-20 minutes about performance. Recommended if you are not familiar with new C++ features yet. For me, this session could be shorter, and some things could be skipped.\nThe Future of C# [and VB] (Dustin Campbel and Mads Torgersen)\nFirst part (presented by Dustin Campbel) is about Roslyn. There is demo how custom code diagnostics can be created. Second part (presented by Mads Torgersen) is about new language features. My observation is that they started adding weird things to the language syntax. More over, Mads talk also about Visual Basic (for ~5 mins), which - as he claims - has a future as well. Mads already had similar session on other conferences (dotNetConf, NDC).\nGo Mobile with C# and Xamarin (Miguel de Icaza)\nGood introduction to Xamarin if you are not familiar with it. There is general overview and philosophy explained. There is also short demo. Good point to get started with Xamarin!\nTypeScript (Anders Hejlsberg)\nAnders Hejlsberg announced TypeScript 1.0. This session is an overview of TypeScript presented in a very solid way. Timestamped draft notes of the entire talk can be found here.\nDeveloping Neural Networks Using Visual Studio (James McCaffrey)\nThis session is worth to see at least for first 8 minutes when James is summarizing entire build conference :) The main content is good intro to Neural Networks. It awakened my desire to learn more about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.\nI&#39;ve seen also: Building a Large Scale JavaScript Application in TypeScript (only slides, no code...), Building a Single Page Application with ASP.NET and AngularJS (I am not a fan of pasting large chunks of code during demos), Avoiding Cloud Fail: Learning from the Mistakes of Azure with Mark Russinovich (advanced, useful if you use Azure intensively), Building Modern Web Applications with Visual Studio and Web Essentials (just update in new Web Essentials features).\n"

    "content"  : "\nI am programming for more than 10 years. I realized that, when I found my first, personal home page (written in PHP) on my hard drive. Some files have last modification date: May 2003. Since that time I was working (or playing) with 9 of top 10 programming language from TIOBE Index list. As I mentioned, I started with PHP, then I learnt a little bit JavaScript (to create fancy menus or &#39;secret pages&#39; on my website). In high school I started learning C++. At the University I learnt C, more C++ and Java. Then I learnt C# on my own, and it is still my favorite language. Along with C# I learnt ASP.NET and T-SQL (to be able to create websites with databases). I also learnt Python and Objective-C. Former became useful when I started my Research Assistant Job.\nMore experience I gain, more interested I am in how things work underneath the code level. In this post I want to provide short description of the Top 10 programming languages (by TIOBE Index), how they work and their super short history.\nPHP\nInterpreted language created by Rasmus Lerdorf. Originally, collection of Perl scripts, rewritten to C for performance reasons, ability to work with web-forms and communicate with databases. Most popular interpreter: Zend Engine. Since PHP 4, the PHP parser compiles input to produce bytecode for processing by the Zend Engine. Facebook developed two PHP interpreters: HipHop (transforms the PHP scripts into C++ code and then compiles) and HipHop Virtual Machine (converts PHP into a high-level bytecode, which is then translated into x86-64 machine code dynamically). Recommended book: PHP and MySQL Web Development.\nJavaScript\nDynamic, interpreted and prototype-based language. JavaScript is superset of ECMAScript standard. Usually used as part of web browser, but also in server-side (Node.js) or even for desktop and mobile application development. Current browsers perform just-in-time compilation. There are many JavaScript engines (interpreters): Rhino (written in Java), SpiderMonkey (written in C, first JS engine), V8 (written C++, by Google, used in Google Chrome), Chakra (performs JIT compilation on a separate CPU core, parallel to the web browser; created by Microsoft, used in Internet Explorer) etc. Recommended book: JavaScript: The Good Parts.\nC/C++\nC is compiled, static type language created by Denis Ritchie. It influenced many other languages, e.g.: C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, and even Unix&#39;s C Shell. C++ is nearly a superset of C, with object oriented features inspired by Simula language, created by Bjarne Stroustrup. C and C++ are compiled to machine specific code, thus platform specific compiler is needed. Most popular compilers: GCC and Visual C++. C++ evolve, Modern C++ (currently C++ 11 and vNext: C++ 14) introduces: smart pointers, for each (range for), lambda functions and much more. Recommended book: Ivor Horton&#39;s Beginning Visual C++ 2012. The C Programming Language (by Brian Kernighan and Denis Ritchie)  used to be one of the most popular programming books ever.\nJava\nC-based language created by James Gosling, which introduces automatic memory management by Garbage Collector. Java is compiled to bytecode (.class files), which runs on JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Its main design goal is &quot;Write Once, Run Anywhere&quot; (WORA). The same code can be compiled to the same bytecode on different machines. Then JVM (platform-specific) translates bytecode to particular machine code during run-time (Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation). Java applets can run in web browser. My personal recommendation for Java book is Hortsmann&#39;s Core Java Volume I - Fundamentals and Volume II - Advanced Features. Well known Java book is Bruce Eckel&#39;s Thinking in Java.\nC#\nC# is Microsoft&#39;s version of Java language created by Anders Hejlsberg. However, C# is closer to C++ in case of design and syntax. It is compiled to Intermediate Language (equivalent of bytecode in Java) and runs on Common Language Runtime (equivalent of JVM). C# also uses Garbage Collector. It has many features not existing in Java like rich native interoperability, query language (LINQ) or dynamic type. For more, check Comparison of C# and Java. Book for quick start: Sams Teach Yourself Visual C# 2010 in 24 Hours recommended by Eric Lippert (former developer of C# compiler). To dive in, check: C# 5.0 in a Nutshell: The Definitive Reference by Joseph Albahari and Ben Albahari, C# in Depth by Jon Skeet and CLR via C# by Jeffrey Richter.\nPython\nDynamic, interpreted language, created by Guido van Rossum. Most popular implementation: CPython (implemented in C). It compiles Python programs to intermediate code (.pyc files) and runs them on Virtual Machine. There are many other implementations, e.g. Jython, which compiles Python to Java Bytecode (.class files). Python is much more expressive language than C or Java. Some constructs, which needs 10 lines of C code or 3 lines of Java code, requires only 1 line in Python (check reverse words example in my post about Python). Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly braces or keywords, to delimit blocks. To get started I recommend Google&#39;s Python Class (videos section) created by Nick Parlante. Other resources: Python tutorial and Dive into Python. You can also check my post Python jump start for more details.\nObjective-C\nStrict superset of C language with object-oriented capabilities inspired by Smalltalk. Every C program can be compiled by Objective-C compiler, C code can be included within Objective-C code. Most popular compilers: Clang and LLVM. Instead of calling methods (like in C++: obj-&amp;gt;method(param)), messages to objects are being sent ([obj method:param]) and resolved at runtime (not at compile time like in C++). There is no Garbage Collector (which works at run-time) in Objective-C, but instead Automatic Reference Counting (compile-time feature) is used. Objective-C is the main programming language used by Apple for the OS X and iOS. However, in this year Apple announced plans to replace Objective-C with new Swift language. Resources to learn Objective-C can be found in my other post.\nTransact-SQL\nDeclarative language for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS). Created by Microsoft (for MS SQL Sever), T-SQL is an extension to SQL, which makes it Turing complete. It adds to SQL: procedural programming, local variables, functions for string and date processing, mathematics etc. and allows FROM clause in DELETE and UPDATE statements (which allows joins to be included). T-SQL (and SQL) query differs from program in such a way that they just tell what to do, not how to do that. Figuring out how to execute query is a role of query analyzer. Check Understanding how SQL Server executes a query.  To learn T-SQL, you should learn SQL first. Recommended tutorial: T-SQL Step by Step Course (video tutorial). Recommended books: Itzik Ben-Gan&#39;s Microsoft SQL Server 2012 T-SQL Fundamentals and other his books.\n(Visual) Basic (.NET)\nCompiled language created by Microsoft. Compiles to native language or P-Code and uses the Microsoft C++ compiler to generate the executable. It derives from BASIC. Similar to Python: tabs and new lines are used to delimit blocks. VB (under Visual Studio) allows to create GUI using drag-and-drop technique. Last version (VB6) was released in 1998 and is abandoned in favor of VB.NET, which introduces many features (present also in C#), but still supported, even on Windows 8. Check Comparison of VB and VB.NET. Both (VB.NET and C#) run on the same run time (CLR). More details can be found here. Recommended tutorials to get started: Visual Basic Fundamentals: Development for Absolute Beginners by Bob Tabor and Visual Basic .NET Tutorials. Good reference is Visual Basic at Wikibooks. To get VB syntax highlighting in SublimeText, this package works.\nSummary\nI read about all 10 languages in Wikipedia before writing this post. I was surprised how much I could learn in 5-10 minutes reading. I don&#39;t know why, but I feel much better now, when I refreshed and organized my knowledge. If you want to start learning about new programming language, I recommend you to read about it on Wikipedia first. Even more, read about all languages you are using now on Wikipedia as well. It gives you great, high-level overview. Now, Wikipedia will be my start point of research about &quot;some new thing&quot;.\n"

    "content"  : "I just found out, that Google Analytics was not counting my blog post pages. Only index page and all other subpages, but not post pages. This pages, which I am linking e.g. on twitter every time I blog!\nFrom some time I was wondering if really only ~10 people are reading my blog. My last post about Getting started with iOS, was visited by 12 people in the day it was published and 10 in the day after.\n\nThen, on Google Analytics, I went to behavior &amp;gt; &#39;site content&#39; &amp;gt; &#39;all pages&#39; to check how many people visited the blog post page. And...there are no post pages in the statistics at all!\n\nI knew that it is impossible, because at least I visited the post page. Then I checked statistics on Azure:\n\nThere are no unique views, but even page views on Google Analytics shows less than 20 per day. I published the post around 11 am, and announced it on twitter 11:18am. Then I got 7030 requests between 12pm and 1pm. It makes sense. Of course 1 Azure request &amp;lt; 1 unique page view. According to Azure Management portal I had 62226 request in last week. How many unique pages views it is? I don&#39;t know and I will never know. But I am sure it is more than 54!\nWhy Google Analytics didn&#39;t track my posts? I put Google Analytics script in index.php file, in my Wordpress theme directory. Apparently I forgot to check if it works for all pages.\nNow, I installed Insert Headers and Footers plugin to insert script from Google. As recommended in How to Install Google Analytics in WordPress for Beginners. It seems to be working fine now. Here are statistics from today:\n\nThere are also other plugins like Google Analytics for WordPress or Google Analyticator, but they insert Google Analytics snippet based on communication with Google api. It means, that if Google change their API for Google Analytics, plugin may not work. I don&#39;t want to be depend on that and just want to paste customized JS code I obtained from Google.\nI also added Azure analytics script. Now, I will be able to cross-check the statistics.\n"

Of course you can use terminal and Vim but...\nObjective-C\nFirst step in learning iOS Development is to learn Objective-C. Good place to start is free Try Objective-C on CodeSchool. There is also Programming with Objective-C on Mac Developer Library, but it is more in documentation style, than tutorial. Choose whatever you like better. To get more deeply there is a great book written by Stephen G. Kochan: Programming in Objective-C. It is for beginners, but discuss all aspects of the language in details.\n\niPhone/iPad programming\nTo get started, there are two nice tutorials:\n\nStart Developing iOS Apps Today on iOS Developer Library - it is an overview of fundamental aspects of iOS development\nGetting Started with iPhone and iOS Development - this is comprehensive overview of iOS Development, from tools to deploying Hello World app on your device\n\nAfter getting familiar with the platform, it is time to become more advanced. My favorite, and the best in my opinion is Stanford course: Developing iOS 7 Apps for iPhone and iPad by Paul Hegarty. He is a great teacher. I really recommend you to go through all lectures and do all homeworks if you think seriously about becoming iOS developer.\n\nTo summarize and sort out your knowledge, there is another great book: iOS Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nUPDATE: Swift\nAt the WWDC 2014 conference, Apple announced new programming language: Swift. This is something, that everybody was waiting for. Finally, we have higher level of abstraction in top of Objective-C, whose expressiveness was simply uncomfortable and not developer-friendly. Swift uses the Objective-C runtime, allowing Objective-C and Swift code to run within a single program. Swift is pretty new thing, but there is already a lot of online resources to learn it. Check Swift Cheat Sheet as high-level overview. More detailed starting point is Ray Wenderlich&#39;s Swift Tutorial: part 1, part 2 and part 3. There is also nice To do list app video tutorial. For more, check Swift at Apple Developer website and free book The Swift Programming Language (bible, over 800 pages).\nSummary\nAll of these resources will give you solid fundaments for iOS development. After getting familiar with them you will be ready to create your own apps and publish them on App Store. Of course it is not required to go through all of them before you start creating your apps. You can just go through basic tutorials and publish your app. However, it may save you a lot of time, which you will need to spend figuring out things. Additionally, you will learn how to do things in a right way.\nUPDATE2: Recently, Udacity released beginner&#39;s guide to Swift Playgrounds, and full blown Intro to iOS App Development with Swift.\nUPDATE3: On iTunes, there is already available updated Developing iOS 8 Apps with Swift from Stanford by Paul Hegarty.\n"

    "content"  : "\nAs a Research Assistant at SAnToS Lab I am working on Medical Device Coordination Framework. It is a long term research effort. MDCF is an implementation of Integrated Clinical Environment. There is many people involved in it. Not only from my University. There are folks from University of Pennsylvania and some other researchers who cooperate with us. My part of research is focused on code translation. You can call it Model Driven Development. The long-term research goal is to create a AADL/BLESS to SPARK Ada translator for Medical Devices.\nTechnologies\nAADL stands for Architecture Analysis &amp;amp; Design Language. It is modeling language, which allows to describe hardware and software parts of the system. It can be represented in graphical and textual form.\nBLESS stands for Behavioral Language for Embedded Systems with Software. It is an extension to AADL language. AADL can be extended by language annexes. BLESS is one of them. It is designed to prove embedded software/system conformance to specification. In other words: to verify the AADL model.\nSPARK is a programming language and static verification technology designed specifically for the development of high integrity software. It is subset of Ada programming language. It contains all features of Ada, except:\n\nPointers\nExceptions\nAliasing between variables\nAll Concurrency features\nSide effects in expressions and functions\n\nHowever, it contains toolset for Software Verification, such as:\n\nExaminer - analyze code and ensures that it conforms to the SPARK language; also verify program to some extent using Verification Conditions (VC)\nSimplifier - simplify Verification Conditions generated by Examiner\nProof Checker - prove the Verification Conditions\n\nI blogged about SPARK Ada recently.\nResearch background\nThe ultimate goal has a big scope. The goal is to deliver a platform, which allows different medical devices to work together. Moreover, there will be monitored and controlled by centralized system.\nWe use and create a lot of different technologies. From AADL, BLESS, DML to SPARK Ada, Java, through many other. Most of them are still under development. I work mainly with AADL, BLESS and SPARK Ada. The biggest challenge for me is to understand how AADL models should be mapped to SPARK Ada in real-World. Unfortunately, I cannot find some Open Source examples on github. Companies treat it as their intellectual property, and do not share it. More over, the AADL committee still did not decide how some AADL constructs should be mapped to Software. Thus, my role is to propose it (based on existing work).\nThere is an AADL to Ada code generator: Ocarina. It is written in Ada and it uses Ada features, which are not in SPARK language. However, it is a good point to start. Another resource I am based on is Aerospace Standard - Architecture Analysis &amp;amp; Design Language (AADL) V2 Programming Language Annex Document. It describe data types translation and base for ports communication.\nThe essence of AADL models is port-based communication. Usually implemented in publish-subscribe mode. It allows to interaction between different components of the system.\nSample medical device\nTo create code translator for Medical Devices, I needed some example of Medical Device. One member of our research group, Brian Larson created AADL/BLESS models of Patient-controlled analgesia Infusion Pump. This device, is used to infuse a pain killer. The dose can be controlled by patient. He also created Open PCA Pump Requirements. Document, which describe precisely functionalities of PCA Pump. My role is to develop AADL/BLESS to SPARK Ada translation schemes and translate existing PCA Pump models, to assure that translation makes sense.\n\nResearch plan\nThere are many issues and problems to solve in this project. One of them is SPARK limitation. Besides excluded features mentioned above, SPARK 2014 does not support multitasking (yet). SPARK 2005 support it in some extent (with Ravenscar profile). Thus I use mainly SPARK 2005.\nThe plan is as follows:\n\nCreate AADL/BLESS to SPARK Ada translation schema\nManually implement working PCA-Pump prototype on BeagleBoard-xM based on Requirement document to find out possible implementation issues\nManually translate AADL/BLESS models to SPARK Ada, reusing code created during implementation\nCreate AADL/BLESS to SPARK Ada translator based on manual translated code\n\nHow it goes?\nI started working on this project around 1 year ago. Most of the time, I spend on studying AADL, SPARK Ada, BLESS and Ravenscar Profile. I thought, I would accomplish much more. However during the process I faced a lot of problems and I had to Shave the Yak. First challenge was to run SPARK Ada code on BeagleBoard-xM device. In cooperation with Ada Core, we got cross-compiler, which works for its processor. It took around 3 months, because cross-compiler was under development. After around half a year of exploring, I came up with AADL ports translation schema (based on AADL annex document). Simultaneously, I was working on PCA Pump implementation (based on its Requirements Document). Most of it is described in SPARK Ada programming for ARM-based device(BeagleBoard-xM). It allowed me to better understand SPARK Ada development environment and create translation schemes for AADL packages threads. SPARK Ada development is much different than Java, C# or Python. After many hours spent on AADL/BLESS models analysis, I created mapping from BLESS to SPARK Ada.\nFor now, most of the work is done. Especially, translations schema. I have less than 2 months to finish everything. My plan is to refactor existing PCA Pump implementation and create final mock of code translated from AADL/BLESS models. Additionally I want to add implementation to some &#39;translated&#39; part and apply SPARK Verification tools and AUnit tests. Finally, I will need to describe everything in my Master Thesis.\nMy thoughts so far...\nDevelopment for safety-critical systems is totally different, than creating Web or Mobile applications. My research adventure is very fascinating and allow me to discover new things everyday. It gives me different perspective of Software Development, which will be useful in the future. No matter if I would work for company producing Aircrafts or Space Shuttles. It will be valuable also for Web/Mobile Start-up in Silicon Valley or personal Mobile App. Finally I understand where UML and variety of Software Design Processes can be applied. Programming in SPARK Ada requires deep thinking and understanding about how every small part of the program work. There is no high abstraction layer, where calling some library function will do all work. It allows to understand what is underneath and how powerful languages like C#, Java or Python are.\nIf you are at the University now, I strongly recommend you to join some Research Group. Or at least talk to some of your professors and ask if you can do some Research-oriented project for him. No matter, if you are Graduate or Undergraduate student. If research topic is out of your comfort zone, then it is even better!\n\n"

    "content"  : "This post is an overview of PhD application process in USA. Application for Master program is usually very similar, but there are differences, specific for every University. Actually, every University has their own requirements, which are similar among the country.\nMy very first advice is to start planning application process at least 1.5 year before the semester in which you want to start your program. In most top Universities the PhD programs are starting only in Fall and application deadline is in mid-December, on the previous year (e.g. for Fall 2014 it is December 2013). Almost 1 year ahead! There are also Universities, which are admitting for Spring as well. However deadline is still around 6+ months before program&#39;s start date.\nTo do list for PhD application\n\nFind Universities/Professors/Research groups you are interested in\nTake standardized tests: GRE and TOEFL(*)\nWrite Statement of Purpose\nGet 3 recommendation letters from your Professors\nGet your transcript of records\nApply!\n\nNow, let&#39;s look at each of the above tasks in details.\nFind Universities/Professors/Research areas you are interested in\nThis choice depends on many factors. It is worth to apply for some top Universities, some good Universities and one or two you are sure you will be admitted. When you are choosing Universities it is good to check its rank in your major. E.g. Harvard (one of the best Universities in USA) is #22 in Best Computer Engineering Grad Schools ranking, while University of Michigan is #5. Even more important than ranking (which is more useful in case of Undergraduate Programs) are Professors and research ares at the chosen University. This part will take you weeks if you are starting from scratch (you have no idea about that). It is worth to ask your professors for advice in selecting Schools.\nMy advice is to choose some 1-3 top Universities, 1-3 average (where you have real chance to be admitted) and 1-2 you are almost sure you will be admitted.\nBe aware that applying for Grad School is not free. You need to pay non-refundable fee for every University you want to apply. Usually the application fee is around $70-80. However some Universities are expensive, e.g. Stanford: $125. As long as you are not rich (and you are probably not, when you are a student), you need to choose Schools you are really interested in to don&#39;t waste your money.\nTake standardized tests: GRE and TOEFL(*)\nDuring Universities/Programs research, you can start preparation and schedule test dates for standardized tests.\n95% of good Universities require GRE (Graduate Record Examinations). Preparation for this exam is usually 1 to 6 months depends on your knowledge. It will be easier for people to whom English is a first language. It will be also easier if you are good at math. Reasonable preparation time for this exam is 1-3 months. More details about that you can find here. There are three sections: Verbal Reasoning (130-170 points), Quantitative Reasoning (130-170 points) and Analytical Writing (0-6 points). I know, it is weird that the minimum score in Verbal and Math is 130 :) The exam takes around 4 hours in total. You need to wait around 2-3 weeks for results. Cost: ~$200 (depends on country/city where you are taking it).\nI think all Universities require TOEFL exam (Test of English as a Foreign Language) if you are international student. There are variety of possibilities to waive it (e.g. if you have US degree, or you are full-time student in USA for more than 2 years), but it depends on the specific University. Test is not very hard, when you can communicate in English without any problems. The challenging part is the fact that it takes more than 4 hours, and you need to stay focused all the time. There are four sections: Reading, Listening, Speaking and Writing (30 points for each, 120 is maximum in total). You need to wait around 2-3 weeks for results. Cost: ~$200.\nEvery University (and some Departments) has GRE code and TOEFL code. You need to provide this code, to specify where you want your results to be sent. In case of GRE I needed to provide this code at the end of exam (in the examination center). In case of TOEFL: &quot;Score report recipients can be added or deleted through the TOEFL iBT® online registration system until 10 p.m. (local test center time) on the day prior to the test date&quot;. Due to that, it is good to check these codes earlier (and take them to the examination center in case of GRE). When I was taking TOEFL and GRE, I was able to select up to 4 institutions to which they send my results without any additional charge. If you want to apply to more Grad Schools you need to order extra results (which is not free). In my case it was $18 for TOEFL and $25 for GRE (per one copy!).\nStatement of Purpose\nIt is similar to cover letter. In Statement of Purpose you should describe what is your interest and relevant experience, which can be useful during PhD research. There are many online resources how to write statement of purpose. E.g.: here and here. What is very important: you need to tell the truth. Especially about your research interest. Based on SoP (Statement of Purpose) you might be admitted or not by specific professor. Remember that PhD is usually 5-6 years and you probably would like to do stuff you are passionate about. Not some things you have never heard about, and do not have any interest in.\nGet recommendations\nGraduate Schools require usually 3 recommendation letters. It is good when 2 are from your professors and 1 from somebody you were working with out of your University (e.g. during Internship or in job before/after College). If you do not have person like that it is fine to get recommendation only from your Faculty members. In general professors don&#39;t like you to see their recommendations. It is not a problem, because you just need to provide their e-mails for Graduate School. Then Graduate School (or Department) send a &#39;request for recommendation&#39; directly to them. They need to reply for this email or upload your recommendation online. Additionally you will get an option to &#39;Waive right to review recommendation&#39;, which means you won&#39;t see the recommendation. I think there are variety of reasons behind that (e.g. student may not like something in the letter, or when he get very good recommendation he may lose motivation etc.). Anyway, you should not be worried about that if you are a good student.\nGet your transcript of records\nIn case of US University this part is easy. You just request transcripts from University and they know what to do. Even when you are not student anymore. In case of foreign country it might be an issue. It was in my case (Poland), but finally (after many phone calls and e-mails) I got them. Fortunately most of Universities accept unofficial copies. Especially from foreign countries, because they are aware of differences between education systems. However, most of Schools require you to send them paper copy of your transcripts. Additionally they are providing specific address to which you should send them. Usually it is Graduate School, but sometimes it might be department. You need to check this on your own.\nApply\nTo do the final step, which is &#39;apply&#39; you need to register in every University&#39;s Grad School online system. After providing all necessary information and listing your recommenders, you need to pay the application fee. Remember about sending your tests (GRE/TOEFL) results and your transcripts to every School.\nNow, let&#39;s look how it goes in practice.\nMy PhD applications\nFinding Universities/Professors/Research areas I am interested in\nI am already in Graduate School (in Master program) at Kansas State University. I am GRA (Graduate Research Assistant) in very strong research group: SAnToS lab. Additionally PhD was only an option for me. It means: it wasn&#39;t my only way (get PhD or die) to move my career forward. Another option was to find a job.\nBecause of that I needed to adjust my recommended strategy (1-3 top + 1-3 average + 1-2 sure Universities). I think my Department is one of average (#85 in Grad Schools ranking) and I had high chances to be admitted (Faculty already knows me, I had experience in their research area etc.). I chose one more average: University of Massachusetts (they work on similar things as I am in my research) and 5 top Universities: Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, MIT, Harvard and University of Pennsylvania.\nTaking standardized tests: GRE and TOEFL(*)\nI took TOEFL before I started Master Program and I got 86/120. I could use it for my PhD applications because the test was taken less than 2 years ago. In most of Universities TOEFL results don&#39;t expire for 2 years.\nI needed to take GRE, because I didn&#39;t take it before. I had to go to Topeka, KS (60 miles from Manhattan, KS where I am currently studying). It was much harder than TOEFL. I learnt some words in English, which I didn&#39;t know even in Polish before. E.g. bigot or ephemeral. Do you know them? My results: 3/6 (Writing), 144/170 (Verbal), 168/170 (Quantitative). Not good in Verbal, but not bad in Quantitative (Math). I thought I have some chances. Especially, because Grad Schools don&#39;t require minimum. They use GRE only as indicator, which means that if you are awesome in different areas, they don&#39;t really care about it. Of course most of people who are awesome in other areas, have also good GRE scores :)\nWriting Statement of Purpose\nIt took me a few days. Especially because I adjusted some parts for specific University. The structure of my SoP was as follows:\n\nsomething about me\nmy experience\nwhat I want to do\nwhy this University\n\nGetting recommendations\nI got recommendations from my major professor, one other professor from my research group and my former manager (from the company I was working for before Graduate School).\nGetting transcript of records\nIt was super easy in case of Kansas State University. I just needed to log in into Internet Student Information System (ISIS), request transcript and provide address to which I want them to be sent. Everything for free ($0!) if you are current student.\nUnfortunately, it was not that easy in Poland. At Wroclaw University of Economics, I needed to prepare it on my own and lovely Ms. Daga had to check if it conforms to data in the online system. No possibility to print it from the system (sic!). Then somebody needed to pick it up in person. I asked my sister, who picked it up and gave them to me, when I was in Poland for Christmas. At Wroclaw University of Technology it was even harder. They do not have procedure to issue transcripts for former students (sic!). I had only one copy of my diploma supplement (which is similar to Transcript of Records). I copied it, went to the dean&#39;s office and ask for University stamp on it. Again in this situation, one women working there was nice and did it for me in the same day (she needed to review manually 7 copies in total!). I hope that this situation will change soon. Students should be able to request transcripts through online system (not necessary for free) and be able to pick it up or get it sent to chosen place.\nApplying\nApplication deadlines of Universities I chose were in the middle of December. E.g. Carnegie Mellon had two deadlines: early in December 4 (fee: $75) and late in December 16 (fee: $125). I sent transcripts after I paid the fee (because I didn&#39;t collect all of them before) and it was fine. The same with recommendations, some of them were sent 5-10 days after deadline. Thus I think the most important part is to send the online application (along with fee). You can send all other documents within some reasonable time (one month?) after deadline.\nResults\n\nStanford - REJECTED\nCarnegie Mellon - REJECTED\nMIT - REJECTED\nHarvard - REJECTED\nUniversity of Pennsylvania - REJECTED\nUniversity of Massachusetts - REJECTED\n\nSounds bad, right? Rejected everywhere. However, I chose 5 top Universities and 1 average. Currently I am at the Kansas State University, which is aspiring to TOP 50 Public Research Universities. Additionally, I am already in very good research group: SAnToS lab. Thus, it was only make sense to apply for better Schools.\nK-State was on my list of Universities, that &quot;I&#39;m sure I will be admitted&quot;. Finally I didn&#39;t apply for PhD program at Kansas State University, because I got a job offer from company I wanted to work for.\nAfter rejection, I sent e-mail to every University asking about rejection reason. Most of them replied, that they &quot;cannot provide details, because of high number of applications&quot;. Only Stanford gave me outline of reasons:\n\nlow score in some sections of GRE (50% in Writing, 45% in Verbal), it is good to have around 90% in every section\nlow GPA: my 4.72 in Poland, converted to USA scale is ~3.23; good students in USA have GPS greater than 3.5 (usually close to 4.0)\nno publications (top Universities like even Undergraduate students with publications)\n\nThey also recommended me to enroll for some Graduate Courses via their Non-Degree Option program. Then, after getting good grades (A+) I will have higher chances to be admitted.\nSummary\nPhD studies might be very good experience and adventure. Especially in USA, where you have opportunity and environment to work on technologies of tomorrow. I was lucky to have this chance during my Master studies. I am working for SAnToS Lab. Our main research areas are Formal Methods and Medical Devices. We have access to pre-releases of IDE (GNAT Programming Studio), which are public 6 or more months later. We are working on standards for Medical Devices, which will be (or not) in the Industry after 20 years from now. It is a lot of other cool stuff, which I describe in the other post.\nBefore you decide pursuing PhD, be aware that it will take 5-6 years (or even more) and you will be around 30 years old when you graduate. During this time you can gain experience in industry or start your own company. Of course you can cancel your PhD studies, but it is better to really think about it before you start application procedure. It also take a lot of time, during which you can applying to some great companies or creating apps.\n"

    "content"  : "\nPiotr Rabiniak asked question about Pomodoro Technique at .NET Developers Poland facebook group. Lot of people replied, that they are using it. So do I. Usually using my Pomidoro Windows 8 app. I don&#39;t use Pomodoro Technique everyday, but there are two main scenarios, when I find it extremely useful:\n\nAt work, when I have many interesting things to check out (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Blogs, etc.). After first Pomodoro, I am in the flow, focused on work. Then I continue and after 4-6 pomodoros lot of things are done.\nAt home (after work), when I want to play with some new technology or do some programming. There is also a lot of distractions, but this time it is worse. After I check all tweets, facebook, news, recent developers conferences, it is 10pm. Then I work till midnight or 1am, and do not have time to rest before the next day. For that, I created a rule: I can spend 4 pomodoros after work. No more, no less. It helps a lot! I come back home, eat dinner, start 4 pomodoros around 8pm, and at 10pm I am done. Additionally, even if it wasn&#39;t enough to accomplish everything I wanted, my excitement level for next day is higher.\n\nFor me, Pomodoro Technique is not a way for living, but sometimes is extremely helpful. The magic happens, because it is only 25 minutes. It is not a lot, but it is enough to get into the flow. And after that you can have a 5 minutes break. In my case, the hardest thing is start working. After I dive in...everything is easy :)\nThere are many Pomodoro apps. I use one on my iPhone and my Pomidoro app for Windows 8.\n"

    "content"  : "For my Research work I need to communicate between Python and Java/Scala application.\nThe first idea was to use WebSockets. It is universal and flexible. Additionally communication is easy. There are many ways to implement it:\n\nws4py - A WebSocket package for Python\nPython Tornado Web Server With WebSockets\nwebsocket-client 0.15.0\nSuper simple websockets client/server using Python\n\nImplementation would be easy, but we are using customized version of Python, which is included in GNAT Programming Studio. Some libraries (required for WebSockets) are excluded (because of legal reasons) and we wouldn&#39;t be able to redistribute it along with missing packages. Thus, we decide to implement interprocess communication through pipes.\nFrom Python to Java\nThe communication is one direction: from Python app to Java app. Every message is one line of text (ultimately: json format). E.g.: &quot;text\\r\\n&quot;. To close communication, we send message: &quot;x\\r\\n&quot;.\nThis is sample Java app, which write received messages to file result.txt:\n[java]import java.io.*;\npublic class MyClass {\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tBufferedReader bufferRead = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n\t\t\tPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(&amp;quot;result.txt&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;);\n\t\t\tString s = bufferRead.readLine();\n\t\t\twhile(s.equals(&amp;quot;x&amp;quot;)==false) {\n\t\t\t\twriter.println(s);\n\t\t\t\ts = bufferRead.readLine();\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\twriter.close();\n\t\t} catch(IOException e) {\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}[/java]\nAnd here is sample Python app, which sends messages to Java app:\n[python]#!/usr/bin/python\nimport subprocess\np = subprocess.Popen([&amp;quot;java&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;MyClass&amp;quot;], stdin=subprocess.PIPE)\np.stdin.write(&amp;quot;First line\\r\\n&amp;quot;)\np.stdin.write(&amp;quot;Second line\\r\\n&amp;quot;)\np.stdin.write(&amp;quot;x\\r\\n&amp;quot;) # this line will not be printed into the file[/python]\nFrom Java to Python\nWe can also communicate in opposite direction: from Java app to Python app. To do that we just need to change reading to writing in Java app and writing to reading in Python app.\nChange in Java app is simple: we just write to standard output.\n[java]import java.io.*;\npublic class MyClass2 {\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException{\n\t\tSystem.out.println(&amp;quot;First msg&amp;quot;);\n\t\tSystem.out.println(&amp;quot;Second msg&amp;quot;);\n\t\tSystem.out.println(&amp;quot;x&amp;quot;);\n\t}\n}[/java]\nIn Python app we need to create stdout pipe and read instead of write:\n[python]#!/usr/bin/python\nimport subprocess\np = subprocess.Popen([&amp;quot;java&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;MyClass2&amp;quot;], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\nline = p.stdout.readline()\nwhile(line != &amp;quot;x\\n&amp;quot;):\n\tprint line\n\tline = p.stdout.readline()[/python]\nIn this scenario, both processes are managed by Python app. You can also do it in opposite direction and invoke Python app from Java app.\n"

I connected it when MacBook was in sleep mode. That is most likely cause of the issue. Probably MacBook thought it is still connected to 42&quot; TV. Thus, changing port helped. Probably, if I connect it to another device, it would help as well.\nIn the past I already had issues when I was disconnecting monitors in sleep mode. Since that time, I was always connecting/disconnecting displays when MacBook was on. Except today :)\n"

    "content"  : "\nRecently I participated in a few Programming Contests: Garmin Programming Competition 2014, ACM programming contest at my University and Google Code Jam 2014. I also remember my first contest in algorithms KPI-Open 2011, in Kiev, Ukraine. It was for teams up to 3 people. There was 16 problems to solve during 2 days. We solved one.\nIn some contests, there is no access to the Internet. It was the case during my first contest (KPI-Open 2011). We were able to use Java, C++ or Pascal. First problem we faced was: &quot;HOW TO READ INPUT FROM CONSOLE IN JAVA?&quot;. None of us remembered. Fortunately, we knew how to do it in C++. Thus we had to use C++ for the first day. We were more proficient in Java though and it slower our development. Before day two, we created check-sheet (we could bring as much printed papers as we wanted) with reading input in Java and some other tricks, which you usually google for. It allowed us to solve one problem. By solving problem I mean, to deliver solution, which pass tests in required amount of time. We solved 7-8 problems (or even more?) during those two days, but only 1 got accepted. It gave us 64 place (among 83 teams).\nA few months after that, I participated in ACM programming contest at Kansas State University with one friend of mine. There was a progress: 1 problem solved in 5 hours (1 day). It is better that 1 problem in 2 days :) Last year, I was 1-person team, and I got 3 problems solved (I was somewhere around 6-10 place). This year: I also solved 3 problems, but it gave me 3rd place.\nLast year, I was also participating in Google Code Jam. In this contest you just need to deliver solution for given input. You download input file from website and you have some amount of time to upload solution (usually up to 10 minutes). Additionally, in most of problems there is small input set and large input set. The large set has more test cases and/or bigger numbers (e.g. int is not enough to solve it).\nThe most important thing during the Programming Contests is time. Time, in which you solve the problem.\nMy general tips (based on competitions I participated in) how to prepare for programming contests:\n\nMake preparation before. Do not just walk-in (especially if it is your first contest). Check Programming Contest Year Plan - Yes a year Plan to be a better Programmer.\nTake Introduction to Algorithms book to the contest.\nCreate (and print if no internet access is allowed) template for standard program. 90% of problems has N test cases. You need to parse it, compute solution and print. My approach is to read all input first and serialize it to e.g. Case class. Then I am looping through all cases and printing output. I prepared a template file, which allows me to save time during the contest.\nFind out what languages/technologies are allowed during the contest and practice with it before the contest. Programming in Eclipse is different than programming in Visual Studio! Especially debugging.\nFind out how you need to provide solution (send source code or just solution?) and how to read/write input/output.\nIf possible, find problems from previous editions of particular contest and practice by solving them.\nDon&#39;t be afraid to write bad code. You don&#39;t need to comply with the best practices. It doesn&#39;t matter, whether your code is not SOLID. Your code is not readable? Who cares? Don&#39;t waste time for refactoring. If you really feel bad with the code your have written - refactor it after the contest. The only thing, which matters is, whether it solve the problem efficiently. Check solutions of the best competitors at Google Code Jam World Finals 2013. Can I write better code? Sure I can. But nobody cares, because they (not me) were the best in last year contest.\n\nSolving algorithmic problems is only part of programmers&#39; skills toolset. If somebody is not good at it, it does not mean he is a bad programmer. He may be good at something else (e.g. programming embedded devices for aircrafts or designing the rocket system). However, it is good to practice problems solving and writing code. It is like daily workout. The programmer who wrote 1000 programs will be always better than one who wrote only 10. You will definitely become a better programmer with programming challenges.\nMy code for ACM contests and Google Code Jam is available on github:\n\nKSU-ACM-Programming-Contests\nGoogleCodeJam\n\n"

    "content"  : "Another class I am taking this semester (except Real-Time Systems which I blogged about) is Formal Language Theory. It is very theoretical course. Most of the time is spend on formal proofs. Fortunately, one programming assignment was very fun.\nThe goal was to implement the program, which checks if one regular expression is subset of another. Thus, the input is two regular expressions.\nThe program use basic regular expressions notation and supports following operators:\n\n+ (union)\n* (Kleene closure)\nε (Epsilon, empty expression)\n0,1,2 (literals)\n\nTo solve the problem, I had to take advantage of finite automatas (ε-NFA and DFA) in following order:\n\nParse regular expressions E1 and E2\nCreate ε-NFAs N1 and N2 using Visitor pattern and transition described here\nConvert ε-NFAs N1 and N2 to DFAs D1 and D2 based on this\nCreate D&#39;I DFA, which is intersection of D1 and D2 DFAs generated in step 3\n\nImplementation details\nTools/Technologies:\n\nEclipse\nScala\nJava\nANTLRWorks 2\nScala JUnit tests\n\nI took advantage of ANTLR for parsing. I want to learn Scala and I am using it for every programming assignment in this semester if possible. ANTLRWorks 2 does not support Scala (it does not generate parser/lexer/visitor in Scala). However, ANTLRWorks 2 generates Java and interoperability between Scala and Java is easy. I decided to try it!\nScala is a main language in which this application was developed. ANTLRWorks 2 was used for parsing regular expression. The new version (v.2) generates Visitor class, which enables iterating through AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) nodes and perform appropriate actions. As I mentioned, ANTLRWorks 2 does not generate Scala code yet. Thus the generated parser and Visitor is in Java language.\nDuring the intersection of DFAs creation, there is an exception thrown in 2 cases:\n\nThere exists some node of newly created D’I DFA, which is sum of D1 final node and D2 not final node\nSome transition, which exists in D1 leads to dead node in D2\n\nException contains string, which is accepted by L(E1), but not by L(E2). Then, this string is returned as a result of execution. If no exception was thrown, it means, every final state of D1 is also final state of D2. That means L(E1) ∈ L(E2) and &#39;true&#39; is returned.\nRunning program\nThe main program is Main.scala. You can find there String variables defined with sample Regular Expressions. The easiest way is to replace them (if you want to test different ones). You can also read input from the console (by commenting and uncommenting appropriate lines).\nEmpty regular exception cause Exception throw.\nThere is also set of unit tests to test some regular expressions. You are more than welcome to add new Unit tests if you want to.\nInput\nEvery closure has to have parenthesis: (exp)*\nUnion also require parenthesis and multiple unions are allowed: (exp1+exp2+exp3)\nSample inputs:\n\n(0+1+2)*\n((0(0+2)*+1)*+2)\n((0(0+2)*+1)*+2+12+(00+21)*+0000110102)\n\nDetails about accepted input can be found in ANTLR grammar file.\nSummary\nIn this assignment I was able to reuse my knowledge about compilers, learnt last semester in Compilers course I had. Additionally I had to implement automata representation and apply recursion to accomplish required tasks.\nIt is very simple translator. Handle only basic regular expressions and small language (only 0,1,2 literals allowed). However, the goal was to practice and understand how Regular Expressions work internally.\nYou can check the code of my translator on github: RegExpTranslator.\n"

    "content"  : "\nSix years ago I purchased Logitech UltraX, which is still the best keyboard I have ever had. Unfortunately, as you know, keyboard cannot live for ever. Two years ago I wanted to buy the same model again, but...UltraX is no longer made. I was looking for some on amazon and ebay, and I found only Logitech Ultra X with PS/2. I bought it and it was fine, but I needed also PS/2-&amp;gt;USB converter (my laptop doesn&#39;t have PS/2 like most of laptops today). It works fine, but sometimes it loses connection. Only solution I found is to disconnect and insert it again into the USB port.\n\nRecently I split a tea on the keyboard and keys are not working very well anymore. Thus I needed a new one. I wanted to buy the same model. It was still available on eBay, but I found this discussion, where one guy recommended Logitech K750. Its price is around $60 (too much), but I found refurbished for $30 (acceptable) and I bought it.\n\nAfter a month, I can say that I am satisfied. It is wireless, but works smoothly (almost like wired). I didn&#39;t have any communication issues so far. The cool thing is the fact that it doesn&#39;t have replaceable batteries. It charges itself through solar panels. Additionally Logitech provides Solar App, which shows the battery condition and how much &#39;light power&#39; is it getting from the light/sun. The two screenshots below shows Solar App when light is turned on (left) and turned off (right).\n\n\n\nThe most important capability: keys. They are nice, low profiled, but a bit loose and loud. It doesn&#39;t bother me though. I can say that K750 is a one class lower than Apple Keyboard, which I was using for 2 months in last summer (working on Mac). I would purchase Apple keyboard (better keys), if it would have &#39;Windows&#39; version. For now, I am satisfied with K750.\nIf you are looking for UltraX-like keyboard, then K750 is definitely worth to consider!\n"

    "content"  : "\nI decided to move my blog from hosting on Webio.pl to Microsoft Azure (formerly Windows Azure before March, 25th 2014). Why? To get more familiar with the Cloud and especially Azure.\nI did my migration following Dave Bost&#39;s series Moving a WordPress Blog to Windows Azure:\n\nPart 1: Creating a WordPress Blog on Windows Azure\nPart 2: Transferring Your Content\nPart 3: Setting Up Your Custom Domain\nPart 4: Pretty Permalinks and URL Rewrite rules\nPart 5: Moving From a Subfolder to the Root\n\nHowever, not everything went smoothly and easy. Additionally, I adjusted some steps to my needs/settings/plugins/hosting(Webio).\nSmall adjustments\nInstead of connecting through FTP to copy content (uploads/themes/plugins), I used UpdraftPlus plugin. Moreover, I am using it for weekly backups all the time. It is really nice, especially the cloud backup option, which allows me to put backup files into my Dropbox automatically.\nTo export my database I used phpMyAdmin provided by Webio. As Portable phpMyAdmin plugin is no longer available, I took advantage of Adminer plugin to import database on Azure. Another option is to install phpMyAdmin on Azure.\nI am using iTheme2 template, which allows to export customized settings (iTheme2/import tab). After migration, you can easily import it going to the same place.\nI had bunch of themes installed. I was testing/experimenting with them when I started my blog. It took me a while to find a way to remove installed theme. You need to go to Appearance/Themes, click on theme you want to remove and then click delete button in right, bottom corner. I deleted all themes, but my current one (iTheme2) and Twenty-* themes.\n\nWebio specific\nSpecific for any hosting provider is setting the custom domain. In order to do that on Webio, you need to go to Domains/Edit DNS entries (in polish: Domeny/Edytuj wpisy w strefie DNS tej domeny). In the image below, there are DNS entries for my domain. Only highlighted entries matters for redirecting domain to Azure:\n\nWhen you add domain entries in Azure you need to add www.* entry separately (in my case: jj09.net and www.jj09.net). More details can be found here.\n\nRemember to create/update web.config file, in order to make your custom domain and permalinks (if you use them) working correctly (as mentioned in part 5 of Dave Bost&#39;s tutorial):\n[xml]&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot; ?&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;\n\t&amp;lt;system.webServer&amp;gt;\n\t\t&amp;lt;rewrite&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t&amp;lt;rules&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;rule name=&amp;quot;Main Rule&amp;quot; stopProcessing=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;match url=&amp;quot;.*&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;conditions logicalGrouping=&amp;quot;MatchAll&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;add input=&amp;quot;{REQUEST_FILENAME}&amp;quot; matchType=&amp;quot;IsFile&amp;quot; negate=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;add input=&amp;quot;{REQUEST_FILENAME}&amp;quot; matchType=&amp;quot;IsDirectory&amp;quot; negate=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;/conditions&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;action type=&amp;quot;Rewrite&amp;quot; url=&amp;quot;index.php&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;/rule&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t&amp;lt;/rules&amp;gt;\n\t\t&amp;lt;/rewrite&amp;gt;\n\t&amp;lt;/system.webServer&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;[/xml]\nIssues\nWhen I was trying to set SMTP server to my gmail I received following email from Google, after try to send test email:\n\nAfter following steps in provided link, the issue was fixed. There is one interesting thing: I set region for my website to WestUS. However, Google says: &quot;Location: Spain&quot;. Hmm...\nAnother issue I had was getting 404 error on .woff file (Crayon Syntax Highlighter plugin font file). I solved it, by modifying web.config file as described here.\nI had also problem with Tweet, Like, Google +1 and Share plugin. It dosn&#39;t display buttons on home page. I tried some tricks (deactivate, re-install) to solve it, but I didn&#39;t succeed.\nPricing\nFor hosting on Webio.pl I was paying around $20/year (start plan). On Azure, I will need to pay at least $10/month for shared instance (required to have domain jj09.net), which is $120/year. 6x more expensive! Am I crazy? No. As I stated at the beginning, I want to play with Azure. When I decide I am done with that, I can always go back to Webio.pl or some other hosting.\nAfter one week, my estimated bill is  2,07 €.\n"

    "content"  : "In this semester I am taking Real-Time Systems course. In one of the programming assignments, we had to develop program for embedded device Tiva C Series LaunchPad TM4C123G. It is a low-cost evaluation platform for ARM Cortex-based microcontrollers from Texas Instruments. It is very nice board if you want to start with embedded devices. It cost only $25 on eBay. You can connect it to your computer using USB. Finally, the board has key feature of embedded device for beginners: the LED. \n\nA typical process-control system can be divided into four types of components: the process, sensors, actuators, and controller (see Figure below). LED allows you to mock your target actuator. Majority of operations performed by embedded devices is control of the actuators. What is nice about LED: it is cheap and easy to control whether and how it is working.\n\nCode Composer Studio\nAs a development environment for Tiva C Series I recommend you Code Composer Studio. It is Eclipse based IDE, which makes development easy. Especially for beginners. Tutorial for installation and running first program on Tiva TM4C123G board using Code Composer Studio can be found here. I recommend to follow the &quot;Single Download&quot; option (download 1GB+ file). More precisely, download and install: &quot;EK-TM4C123GXL-CCS: TivaWare for C Series and Code Composer Studio for the Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad&quot; available on this website. I wasted a lot of time trying to install it following &quot;Individual Downloads&quot; instructions (download &amp;lt;1MB file). Installer was hanging, when it was downloading files form the Internet and never recovers. In &quot;Single Download&quot; most of files are already downloaded along with the installer.\nFreeRTOS\nFreeRTOS is one of the most popular Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS). Additionally, it is free. This is where its name comes from (free + Real Time Operating System = FreeRTOS). The System is written in C language. Thus, we write programs for it in C as well. More details can be found on freertos.org and wikipedia.\nThe cool thing about FreeRTOS is that it enables easy modifications of Operating System. You can modify e.g. scheduler.\nOnce you have Code Composer installed. You need to install TivaWare software (which includes FreeRTOS). It can be found in previously downloaded package (if you were following &quot;Single download&quot; option) in TivaWare/SW-EK-TM4C123GXL-1.1.exe.\nRunning example programs\nThe TivaWare software contains examples, which are ready to run. You can find them in the directory, where you installed TivaWare C Series software. In my case (default path) it is: C:\\ti\\TivaWare_C_Series-1.1\\examples.\nThere is an example project freertos_demo. It makes the LED blinking and allows you to manipulate the colors using buttons (located at the bottom of the board). The project can be found in examples\\boards\\ek-tm4c123gxl\\freertos_demo. It is ready to run. You just need to connect the board to the PC, open the project (import it) in Code Composer Studio and run it in debug mode. Code Composer Studio will automatically port the program into the board.\nYou can modify the code, and make the LED blinking faster or slower. Colors manipulation is also easy.\nQueues and semaphores\nFreeRTOS supports multitasking. In the Real-Time systems, communication between different tasks are usually implemented using queues and semaphores. It is also the case in freertos_demo program. Buttons send messages to the LED using queues. Semaphores are use to guard concurrent access to UART. \nThis tutorial is very good point to start with FreeRTOS. It describes basics, queues, semaphores and more.\nSummary\nDeveloping code for embedded devices is usually, more complex than for Web or Desktop. Running, even very simple application is more complex, because it requires more steps. You need to configure connection between your computer/OS and specific device. Then you need to setup many settings, which varies almost among every device. The communication with ports is also different and every device has different set of them.\nThere are no universal installers etc. Every single device require slightly different setup. Sometimes, you need to spend hours to run simple &quot;Hello, World!&quot; application. On the other hand, it is fun to create some system, which do stuff outside of your PC.\nIf you are interested in embedded devices, check out my other post: BeagleBoard - your personal computer smaller than your wallet.\nTo get started with FreeRTOS and Tiva C Series: check this tutorial to run first program and FreeRTOS Tutorial to get more details. You can buy Tiva C Series LaunchPad on eBay.\n"

    "content"  : "Before I joined SAnToS Lab, I heard about Ada programming language only a few times. I thought it is an ancient language, that nobody is using anymore. I assumed, that only reason why somebody may bother are some legacy applications written 30 years ago. I thought that safety-critical and high-assurance systems are developed in C/C++ or even Assembly language.\nI was wrong.\nAda programming language\nFirst version of Ada programming language - Ada 83 - was designed to meet the US Department of Defence Requirements formalized in &quot;Steelman&quot; document. Since that time, Ada evolved. There were Ada 95, Ada 2005 and Ada 2012 (released in December 10, 2012). Ada is activelly used in many Real-World projects, e.g. Aviation (Boeing 777&#39;s Software is written in Ada), Railway Transportation, Commercial Rockets, Satellites and even Banking. One of the main goals of Ada is to ensure software correctness and safety. The picture below, shows what is the goal of Ada: prevent the Developer from introducing bugs into system by rich tooling and language properties.\n\nAda does not use curly braces. The code listing below shows &quot;Hello, World&quot; in Ada:\n\nwith Ada.Text_IO; \nuse Ada.Text_IO;\n\nprocedure Hello is \nbegin   \n  Put_Line (&quot;Hello, world!&quot;); \nend Hello;\n\nBasic constructs\nThe table below, shows C# code, and equivalent Ada code.\n\n\n\nC#\nAda\n\n\n\n\nx = 5;\n\n\n\n\nx := 5;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx == 5\n\n\n\n\nx = 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx != 5\n\n\n\n\nx /= 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// comment\n\n\n\n\n-- comment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nint i = 2;\nConsole.WriteLine(i);\n\n\n\n\ni : Integer := 2;\nPut_Line(Integer&#39;Image(i));\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif (a &amp;amp;gt; b)  \n{\n  Console.WriteLine(&quot;Condition met&quot;);  \n}  \nelse  \n{\n  Console.WriteLine(&quot;Condition not met&quot;);\n}\n\n\n\n\nif a &amp;amp;gt; b then   \n Put_Line(&quot;Condition met&quot;);\nelse   \n Put_Line(&quot;Condition not met&quot;); \nend if;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nswitch(i) \n{\n  case 0:     \n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;zero&quot;);     \n    break;   \n  case 1:\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;one&quot;);     \n    break;\n  case 2:     \n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;two&quot;);     \n    break;   \n  default:     \n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;none&quot;);     \n}\n\n\n\n\ncase i is   \n  when 0 =&amp;amp;gt; Put_Line(&quot;zero&quot;);   \n  when 1 =&amp;amp;gt; Put_Line(&quot;one&quot;);   \n  when 2 =&amp;amp;gt; Put_Line(&quot;two&quot;);   \n  when others =&amp;amp;gt; Put_Line(&quot;none&quot;);\nend case;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfor (int i=1; i&amp;amp;lt;=10; ++i)  \n{\n  Console.WriteLine(&quot;Iteration: &quot;);   \n  Console.WriteLine(i);   \n  Console.WriteLine(&quot;&quot;);  \n}\n\n\n\n\nfor i in 1 .. 10 loop\n  Put_Line(&quot;Iteration: &quot;);   \n  Put_Line(Integer&#39;Image(i));\n  Put_Line(&quot;&quot;);\nend loop;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhile(a != b)  \n{\n  Console.WriteLine(&quot;Waiting&quot;); \n}\n\n\n\n\nwhile a /= b loop   \n  Put_Line(&quot;Waiting&quot;); \nend loop;\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndo \n{\n  a++;    \n} \nwhile(a!=10);\n\n\n\n\nloop   \n  a := a + 1;   \n  exit when a = 10; \nend loop;\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages\nThe equivalent for C# class - in Ada - is package. It has two files: specification (.ads file) and body (.adb file). It is like header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files for class definition in C++. Additionally:\n\nclass variables in C# conforms to &#39;global&#39; variables in Ada package (the name &#39;global&#39; in Ada package means that variable is visible for entire package, not entire application like in C/C++)\nC# class have methods, which returns value or not (void). In Ada, methods are called subprograms. There are two distinguished types of them: functions (returns something) and procedures (does not return anything).\n\nHere is sample C# class:\n\nclass Person  \n{\n  public int publicVar;\n\n  private int privateVar;\n\n  void MyMethod(int param)\n  {\n    // do stuff\n  }\n\n  public int MultiplyBy(int param) \t\n  {\n    return param * 2\n  }\n}\n\nAnd its equivalent package in Ada:\n\n-- person.ads\npackage Person is\n  publicVar : Integer; \t\n\n  procedure MyMethod(Param : Integer);   \n   \n  function MultiplyBy(Param : Integer) return Integer; \nend Person;\n\n-- person.adb\npackage body Person is \t\n  privateVar : Integer;\n\n  procedure MyMethod(Param : Integer)\n  is\n  begin\n    -- do stuff\n  end;\n\n  function MultiplyBy(Param : Integer)\n  is\n    Result : Integer;\n  begin\n    Result := Param * 2;\n    return Result;\n  end;\nend Person;\n\nSPARK Ada\nSPARK programming language is based on Ada. Thus, it is usually referred as &quot;SPARK Ada&quot;.\nSPARK is a programming language and static verification technology designed specifically for the development of high integrity software. First version was designed over 20 years ago. SPARK excludes some Ada constructs (i.e. pointers, dynamic memory allocation or recursion) to make static analysis feasible. Additionally SPARK contains tool-set for Software Verification:\n\nExaminer - analyze code and ensures that it conforms to the SPARK language; also verify program to some extent using Verification Conditions (e.g. array index out of range, type range violation, division by zero, numerical overflow etc.)\nSimplifier - simplify Verification Conditions generated by Examiner\nProof Checker - prove the Verification Conditions\n\nUsing SPARK, a developer takes a Z specification and performs a stepwise refinement from the specification to SPARK code. For each refinement step a tool is used to produce verification conditions (VC&#39;s), which are mathematical theorems. If the VC&#39;s can be proved then the refinement step will be known to be valid. However if the VC&#39;s cannot be proved then the refinement step may be erroneous.\nFirst version of SPARK (SPARK 83) was based on Ada 83. The second version (SPARK 95) - on Ada 95. Current version - SPARK 2005 - is based on Ada 2005. It is a subset of Ada 2005 with annotations. The annotation language support flow analysis and formal verification. Annotations are encoded in Ada comments (via the prefix --#). It makes every SPARK 2005 program, valid Ada 2005 program. Code listing below shows example SPARK 2005 package specification.\n\npackage Odometer\n--# own Trip, Total : Integer;\nis\n\tprocedure Zero_Trip;\n\t--# global out Trip;\n\t--# derives Trip from ;\n\t--# post Trip = 0;\n\n\tfunction Read_Trip return Integer;\n\t--# global in Trip;\n\n\tfunction Read_Total return Integer;\n\t--# global in Total;\n\n\tprocedure Inc;\n\t--# global in out Trip, Total;\n\t--# derives Trip from Trip &amp;amp;amp; Total from Total;\n\t--# post Trip = Trip~ + 1 and Total = Total~ + 1;\n\nend Odometer;\n\nIt is an interface for simple Odometer. There are 4 subprograms (2 procedures and 2 functions):\n\nZero_Trip procedure - reset Odometer to 0\nRead_Trip function - returns current distance\nRead_Total function - returns total distance traveled\nInc procedure- increment total and current distance by 1\n\nAnnotation global means that subprogram uses some global variable. Postfix in, out or in out means that particular variable is read, write or read and write respectively. Annotation derives says that some variable value depends on other variables. E.g. in procedure Inc variable Trip is dependent on its current value (before procedure call). Annotations pre and post define pre- and postconditions of procedure (only post is present in above example). We can see, that in Zero_Trip procedure postcondition requires that variable Trip is equal to 0. In procedure Inc, postconditions requires that variables Trip and Total are incremented by 1 (&#39;~&#39; is the value of variable before procedure call). Annotation own expose private variables for use in public methods specification.\nWe can see, that SPARK contracts describe the functionality of particular subprograms. It is like documentation. You can find more about SPARK contracts in Tokeneer Discovery tutorial and SPARK 2005 to SPARK 2014 Mapping Specification.\nThe most popular IDE for SPARK Ada development is GNAT Programming Studio. There is also Eclipse plugin GNATbench.\nThe next version, SPARK 2014 (based on Ada 2012) is under development. There is partial tool support (in GNAT Programming Studio), but some language features are still not supported. It is worth to mention, that Ada 2012 contains code contracts. Thus SPARK 2014 is just subset of Ada 2012. There are no additional constructs like annotations in SPARK 2005, because now, contracts are part of the language.\nIn real-world applications, the embedded critical components are written in SPARK while the non-critical components are written in Ada.\nSummary\nI am working with SPARK Ada for more than 1 year. My (beginner) thoughts are as follows:\n\nI don&#39;t like the syntax. It is not developer friendly. You need to do a lot of repetitions, of the same code (e.g. subprograms declaration/definition). Syntax is very verbose, e.g. code blocks starts with begin and ends with end keywords. It means more writing than in case when you use &#39;curly braces&#39; for that.\nIt is very hard to create valid and working SPARK program. There are many rules and limitations (e.g. no dynamic allocation).\nQuite steep learning curve. Additionally, it is not easy to find some resources like tutorials, books, videos.\nSPARK Ada IDE - GNAT Programming Studio - is very specific, and different than the most popular IDEs (e.g. Visual Studio or Eclipse). It is also less powerful, in case of e.g. intellisense, key shortcuts or project manipulations.\n\nFrom my perspective, SPARK is a temporary subset of Ada, chosen for software verification. Once, verification techniques evolves, more features of Ada are getting included in SPARK. Maybe, in some day, there will be no SPARK, but just Ada, and tools will be able to verify (reason about) all its features.\nMore about Ada you can find at Ada Programming at Wikibooks, AdaCore University (video tutorials) and at ada2012.org website. Good place to start getting familiar with SPARK is Tokeneer Discovery tutorial (SPARK 2005) and SPARK 2014 tutorial. This lecture gives SPARK overview in nutshell. More about SPARK 2014 can be found in SPARK 2014 website, SPARK 2014 Toolset User&#39;s Guide and SPARK 2014 Reference Manual. To go deeper, there is a book SPARK: THE PROVEN APPROACH TO HIGH INTEGRITY SOFTWARE by John Barnes.\n"

It is definitely better to do it sooner, even just for exercise, than later.\nEveryone who attend a University and got a CS degree had to write at least one concurrent application. Usually, in Java, as &#39;standard language for Universities&#39;. At least that was in my case, and two Universities I attended (Wroclaw University of Technology and Kansas State). Many University-based resources from Google are in Java. Sometimes there is C/C++ used. That&#39;s my observation after googling.\nAs .NET Developer I was interested in multithreading in C#. One of the best sources about that is Threading in C# by Joseph Albahari. It&#39;s an overview of all threading-related features in C#. In this post, I would like to make an overview of the most basic techniques: accessing shared resources and signaling.\nBasic locking\nThe issues with threading are usually correlated with shared resources (e.g. variables). One thread can start modifying it, while in meantime another thread also start do that. Then, sometimes, we cannot predict the final state of the resource (value of variable). Moreover, in one execution it can be value set by thread #1 and in the other - by thread #2.\nTo solve this issue, we have constructs such as: semaphors or monitors. In C#, the monitor implementation is lock statement. To apply it, we need &#39;locker object&#39;, which has to be locked before access to shared resources and unlocked after. Once &#39;locker object&#39; is locked, other threads has to wait until it becomes unlocked. Look at below example (from Albahari&#39;s eBook):\n[csharp]using System;\nusing System.Threading;\nclass ThreadTest\n{\n  static bool done;    // Static fields are shared between all threads\n  static void Main()\n  {\n    new Thread (Go).Start();\n    Go();\n  }\n  static void Go()\n  {\n    if (!done) { done = true; Console.WriteLine (&amp;quot;Done&amp;quot;); }\n  }\n}[/csharp]\nThe bool variable done is shared resource. Above program will have 2 threads. First one, starts in a new thread and second one, right after the first one, in main thread. Both will try to access shared resource. We can see that during method Go() execution, the shared variable is accessed actually 2 times. First - to check its value, and second - to set it (if it was false). The problem is that thread #1 can access it first (when it is false), then give up processor for thread #2, which also will check the value (still false) and we will get &quot;Done&quot; printed twice. That&#39;s something we do not want. To solve this issue, we introduce &#39;locker object&#39; represented by variable locker.\n[csharp]using System;\nusing System.Threading;\nclass ThreadSafe\n{\n  static bool done;\n  static readonly object locker = new object();\n  static void Main()\n  {\n    new Thread (Go).Start();\n    Go();\n  }\n  static void Go()\n  {\n    lock (locker)\n    {\n      if (!done) { Console.WriteLine (&amp;quot;Done&amp;quot;); done = true; }\n    }\n  }\n}[/csharp]\nNow, the if statement is secured by lock. Every thread, which wants to enter it, has to obtain the lock. Once one thread obtain the lock, another threads cannot. They have to wait, until it becomes unlocked. In above example, when thread #1 has the lock and start executing critical section, then even if it give up for thread #2, we have warranty that another thread will not enter the critical section. Additionally, only thread #1 can release the lock.\nThe following code:\n[csharp]lock(locker)\n{\n    //code\n}[/csharp]\nis equivalent to (C# 4.0):\n[csharp]bool lockTaken = false;\ntry\n{\n  Monitor.Enter (locker, ref lockTaken);\n  //code\n}\nfinally { if (lockTaken) Monitor.Exit (locker); }[/csharp]\nSignaling\nAnother common technique in multithreaded applications is signaling. It is notifying other thread(s). For example: thread #1 can start another thread (thread #2) and wait for signal from it (e.g. that it finished some operation). Thread #2 is performing the operation, while thread #1 is waiting. Once thread #2 finish operation, it notify (send signal) thread #1, which then can continue other computations.\nIn the example below, then main thread, create new thread to perform Operation. After that it performs some computation and when it is done, it waits for thread #2 to finish its operations. After main thread get notification from thread #2, it can proceed.\n[csharp]using System;\nusing System.Threading;\nclass BasicWaitHandle\n{\n  static EventWaitHandle _waitHandle = new AutoResetEvent (false);\n  static void Main()\n  {\n    new Thread (Operation).Start();\n    Thread.Sleep (1000);                  // Computation...\n    Console.WriteLine (&amp;quot;Wait...&amp;quot;);\n    _waitHandle.WaitOne();                    // Wait for notification\n    Console.WriteLine (&amp;quot;Notified!&amp;quot;);\n  }\n  static void Operation()\n  {\n    Console.WriteLine (&amp;quot;Start operation...&amp;quot;);\n    Thread.Sleep(2000);               // Computation...\n    Console.WriteLine (&amp;quot;Operation finished!&amp;quot;);\n    _waitHandle.Set();                // Notify the Waiter\n    Thread.Sleep(1000);         // Some other computation...\n  }\n}\n[/csharp]\nProducer-Consumer\nThe classic multithreaded application is Producer–consumer. Additionally, it is wide used across many real-life applications. In the listing below, there is Producer-Consumer implementation in C# (taken from Threading in C# - part 2):\n[csharp]using System;\nusing System.Threading;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nclass ProducerConsumerQueue : IDisposable\n{\n  EventWaitHandle _wh = new AutoResetEvent (false);\n  Thread _worker;\n  readonly object _locker = new object();\n  Queue&amp;lt;string&amp;gt; _tasks = new Queue&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;();\n  public ProducerConsumerQueue()\n  {\n    _worker = new Thread (Work);\n    _worker.Start();\n  }\n  public void EnqueueTask (string task)\n  {\n    lock (_locker) _tasks.Enqueue (task);\n    _wh.Set();\n  }\n  public void Dispose()\n  {\n    EnqueueTask (null);     // Signal the consumer to exit.\n    _worker.Join();         // Wait for the consumer&#39;s thread to finish.\n    _wh.Close();            // Release any OS resources.\n  }\n  void Work()\n  {\n    while (true)\n    {\n      string task = null;\n      lock (_locker)\n        if (_tasks.Count &amp;gt; 0)\n        {\n          task = _tasks.Dequeue();\n          if (task == null) return;\n        }\n      if (task != null)\n      {\n        Console.WriteLine (&amp;quot;Performing task: &amp;quot; + task);\n        Thread.Sleep (1000);  // simulate work...\n      }\n      else\n        _wh.WaitOne();         // No more tasks - wait for a signal\n    }\n  }\n}\nclass Program\n{\n\tstatic void Main()\n\t{\n\t  using (var q = new ProducerConsumerQueue())\n\t  {\n\t    q.EnqueueTask (&amp;quot;Hello&amp;quot;);\n\t    for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10; i++) q.EnqueueTask (&amp;quot;Say &amp;quot; + i);\n\t    q.EnqueueTask (&amp;quot;Goodbye!&amp;quot;);\n\t  }\n\t  // Exiting the using statement calls q&#39;s Dispose method, which\n\t  // enqueues a null task and waits until the consumer finishes.\n\t}\n}[/csharp]\nIt takes advantage of locking and signaling. Producer is creating tasks and putting them into the buffer. Consumer is consuming tasks (fetching them from the buffer). In above program: the buffer is implemented as Queue. \nThere are two threads:\n\nMain thread - creating tasks and adding them into the queue (enqueuing)\nWork thread - processing tasks (dequeuing)\n\n&#39;Work thread&#39; is consuming tasks if the queue is not empty. If the queue is empty, instead of checking its content continuously, it waits for the signal from Main thread. The Main thread notify Work thread every time it enqueued new task into the queue. Work thread terminates, once it receive null task. In above program, it happens when we quit the using statement in Main thread. That cause Dispose() method call (in ProducerConsumerQueue class), which enqueues null task into the queue. During enqueuing and dequeuing, the queue is locked using lock construct.\nMore detailed description of this implementation can be found on Joe Albahari&#39;s article.\nSummary\nThere are many advantages of multithreading: speeding up applications by performing operations in different thread, while processor is waiting for I/O operation or making UI thread responsive all the time, while processing is done in background. However, multithreaded applications are much harder to find bugs and debug. Because of that: you should avoid multithreading everywhere when possible. Especially, when threads access the shared resource.\nTo get familiar with multithreading you can read Introduction to Multithreading (with examples in Java) and Multi-threading in .NET: Introduction and suggestions (with &quot;Hello, world&quot; example in C#).\nFor a jump start you may find useful a session from TechEd New Zealand 2012: Multi-threaded Programming in .NET from the ground up (it&#39;s 2 years old, but still accurate).\n\nTo learn more about multithreading in C#, I strongly recommend you Threading in C# by Joseph Albahari, which is also part of C# 5.0 in a Nutshell (book I am reading now...and also recommending!). \n"

    "content"  : "Over a year ago I created simple Windows 8 app: Pomidoro (the name &#39;Pomodoro&#39; was already taken at the Windows Store). And yes, it is for applying The Pomodoro Technique. I published it to the Windows Store on January 7, 2013. \n\nThe reason I created this app, was to learn Windows 8 Metro apps development. \nFrom time to time I receive e-mails that my app got some third party award or was reviewed by some website I have never heard about.\nA few weeks ago I received e-mail from Best Windows 8 Apps. My app received Editor&#39;s pick award:\n\nA few days ago I received e-mail from AppFeds. They states, that they are tracking 116,642 apps. Windows 8 Store contains over 144,739 (source). Now, my app is 579/673 in the productivity category.\n\n\nI checked how many productivity apps they have and I was a little bit surprised. They have 673 apps in category Productivity. How is this possible that my app was ranked 958 in January 31? Did they have more apps or they are just lying? First warning about credibility of their website.\nEDIT (after clarification from AppFeds, see comment): They have more than 2800 apps in category Productivity and almost 700 of them are well received. My app was 958 in January, now is 674. Yesterday (before the comment from AppFeds was posted), my app was 557.\n\nBut, in the same time, my app is in page 38, when I sort Productivity apps, by ranking (with &#39;Well Received&#39; filter off). There is 10 apps per page, which means my app is in top 380(?) Why there is a difference between the list and above chart? Maybe guys from AppFeds can explain that as well? &amp;lbrack;End Of Edit&amp;rbrack;\nYesterday I received another e-mail. It made me to create this post. The e-mail was from I Love Free Software:\nHi jj09 team,\nI am Ubaidullah from www.ilovefreesoftware.com. We recently reviewed Pomidoro on our website here:\nhttp://www.ilovefreesoftware.com/24/featured/free-pomodoro-timer-apps-windows-8.html\nWe are a popular tech website and get hundreds of thousands of visitors from over 150 countries around the world. \nIt would be great if you could add a link to the review on your website. This would tell your visitors that we have reviewed your app as one of the best free app available (and that would add up to your credibility as well).\nI have attached a badge with this mail which you can flaunt on your website, and link that to the review. Alternatively, you can just add this code:\n&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ilovefreesoftware.com/24/featured/free-pomodoro-timer-apps-windows-8.html&quot; title=&quot;Free Software&quot; &amp;gt;&amp;lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://cdn.ilovefreesoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ilovefreesoftware_reviewed_5Star.png&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\nFeel free to get back to me with any questions.\nHave Fun,\nUbaidullah Khan\nCollaboration Manager\nI checked this review. Doesn&#39;t look like a simple scam. It is neither high quality review. The cool thing is my app is 1st of 4 best Pomodoro apps :) This is the badge from them:\n\n* Of course I didn&#39;t paste link provided by them. The picture is stored on my server for security reasons.\nIs that means my tiny app is good? Maybe average Windows Store apps are not very high quality (if app created within one day can be better than them)? Or maybe there are people who trying to get their websites popular, by scaming Windows Apps&#39;s creators? I think the last reason is the most likely :)\nNow, let&#39;s look at the most accurate statistics - Windows Store:\n\nThe problem here is following: how can I check how good my app is? The best way to do that is compare it with other apps. But how? I was trying to find some Apps rankings on Windows Store websites and I didn&#39;t find any. Maybe I am not good google user. I found some ranking on Microsoft Store for Windows Phone (using Bing), but not for Windows 8.\nI know, I am feeding scammers by linking these third party websites here. On the other had, some of them (e.g. this or that) have better UX than Windows Store websites. I spent 10 minutes trying to find Windows Store Apps rankings online and I failed. I know you can sort Apps in Windows Store by popularity, but why it is not available online? In the same time, third party websites like AppFeds have pretty nice and clear UX for Apps Catalogs. Their data may be not accurate, but the UI is nice. Maybe guys from Microsoft should think about something like that?\n"

The most popular LaTeX distribution for Mac is MacTeX (for Windows: MiKTeX or TeXlive). Once I had this installed I needed editor. First I was using TeXworks, but it is not very decent environment. Nice thing about it is the built-in PDF viewer. Every time I rebuild the document it refresh generated pdf. However, it&#39;s hard to manage documents with more than one .tex file. My Master Thesis consists multiple files and I end up editing files in SublimeText and building pdf with TeXworks. Not cool!\nToday, one friend of mine showed me application, which detects .pdf updates automatically: Skim. I have also found LaTeXTools plugin for SublimeText. It allows to build .tex document with CMD+B (Mac) or CTRL+B (Windows/Linux).

    "content"  : "Yesterday at my university, Garmin was hosting the Programming Competition.\nCompetition like that is a great opportunity to practice programming, algorithms and problem solving skills. \nWe could form teams of 1-2 students. My partner was Daniel Wang. We could use following languages: C++, C#, Java and Python. We chose Java. We were using Eclipse IDE and git to share the code.\nOrganizers prepared very real-life problems. \nCompetitions had two parts:\n\nRead and perform simple input conversion (1 hour).\nReuse code from Program 1 and do more complicated operations with input (3 hours).\n\nWe solved part 1 without any problems. Part 2 required two programs: 2A and 2B. We solved both, but our programs didn&#39;t pass all test cases. In 2A: 3/5 test cases passed, in 2B: 4/5. There were points for correct solution and bonus points (depended on the time when solution was submitted). Additionally, there was a timer showing how many bonus points we could earn sending solution now.\nYou can find problems description here. Our solutions are available on Bitbucket repository. Be aware that it is bad code, written under time pressure and never refactored. However, efficient enough to pass required time constraints. This is how you write code during programming contests :)\nAfter competition we asked organizers about test input sets and they sent it to us. \nThis is the description of the bug we had and how we fix it (you can skip this part if you don&#39;t want to read the description of problems):\nThe issue we had, was reading (shift mod 26) straight from the input file. Because e.g. shift = 45 should be effectively shift = 19 (45 mod 26). The program should stop when shift = 0. Then, when original shift was e.g. 52 we had stored shift=0 and we stopped (which was wrong). We thought that we should stop when the &#39;effective shift&#39; is 0. Unfortunately, the test cases were stopping when the &#39;original shift&#39; was 0. Fix was pretty easy (we just store two values: shift and shiftOrig for each cell). It would be very hard to fix this without test cases from organizers ;) It was like in real-life: small detail caused significant error.\nThe challenge during programming competitions is that you cannot get all test cases. This time, there were 1 sample input per program. Which make sense, because otherwise everybody could just hardcode expected solution :) What is worse, you cannot see the program output (in case of runtime error). Fortunately, guys form Garmin were nice and when we asked, they were showing us the output (on their machine). It helped us (a lot) in fixing the runtime errors (during the competition).\nThe next event I am looking forward is  Google Code Jam. It starts in April 11, 2014 (Friday). Registration begins in March 11. I really encourage you to sign up. You can learn what various problems you can face and what you should consider during writing your programs. Additionally you can practice, apply your programming skills and compete with the best programmers in the World.\n"

    "content"  : "In the last semester (Fall 2013) I had a pleasure to take course CIS706 - Translator Design (aka Compilers) with Dr Robby at Kansas State University. It was great experience! I think it is the best course I have ever taken.\nThe way how this course is designed is just amazing. During course about compilers you will also learn many other useful things:\n\nJava\nEclipse\nSource Control (git)\nUnit Testing (JUnit) and TDD\nReading legacy code\nJava Byte Code\n\nHow? You have to build the compiler for simple, Java based language called ExtendedStaticJava. You have 4 homeworks: parsing, building AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), type checking and byte code generation. For each of them you have &#39;legacy&#39; code, which implements compiler for StaticJava. Your task is to extend it to handle ExtendedStaticJava syntax. For each homework you get around 100 Unit Tests. Your grade depends on number of passing tests. If all test are passing you get 100%. Implementation does not matter...but you might need to pay for workarounds later, because each homework is based on the code from previous one. I experienced this. I made a few hacks in first homework and then I needed to fix them during homework 2. It cost me extra time and I had to send incomplete solution. It is exactly how it goes in &quot;Real World&quot;! \nFor final project (last month of semester) we needed to create ExtendedStaticJava to C transpiler with Garbage Collector. Transpiler is source-to-source compiler. In other words: resulting code was C with Garbage Collector calls (GC was also implemented by us in C). We reused our homeworks (without byte code generation part) and generated C code (with GC calls) using StringTemplate.\nLet&#39;s take a look how all above help us to be better developers. \nMost of students probably already know Java. If not - this course is the best time to learn. Java and C# are the most popular, static typing programming languages (today). When you learn one of them - it is easy to catch up with another. Java is still the most popular language in case of job offers (source):\n\nThus, probability that you will be programming in Java after you graduate is pretty high. When you will be programming in Java, you will be probably using Eclipse - its most popular IDE. Another &#39;standard&#39; in industry is Source Control. If the company you are working for is not using it - you should change your company(!), because something wrong is going on there. If you are not familiar with git (leader in Open Source community, now being adapted by the industry) then this course is the best time to learn. Nowadays, even big companies (e.g. Microsoft) open sourcing their code (e.g. ASP.NET or SignalR), which is available through git.\nUnit testing is very popular nowadays. Lots of commercial projects use this technique to ensure software quality and development stability. Many projects are also using TDD (Test Driven Development) approach. First your write the test (as the requirement) and then code. When test pass, you refactor the code. During the course we were using JUnit (for now: No.1 Unit Test Framework for Java). Additionally, when you learn how to work with Unit Tests, then picking up a different framework is very easy (even in different language).\nSoftware Development is a team work. Because of that, you will need to read code of other developers everyday. In most of courses during your University career you need to create some applications from scratch. Sometimes you are working in team of 2 or 3 people. Then in your first job, you get 100 000 lines of code written by somebody else. Often without documentation and sometimes people who wrote this code are not working there anymore. In other words - you&#39;re screwed. Compilers class will prepare you for that. During the course you will need to understand the existing code (StaticJava compiler), extend it and introduce some changes to get ExtendedStaticJava compiler working and Unit Tests passing.\nBesides learning Java, you will also learn how JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and ByteCode are working. The idea of intermediate code is also used in C#: code is compiled to an Intermediate Language (IL) which then runs in the Common Language Runtime (CLR). It is very helpful for understanding how high-level code is translated to Assembly language.\nIt is also worth to mention about the essence of the course: compilers. The course is based on the popular Dragon Book. You will learn about every stage of compiling: lexical analysis, parsing, creating AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), semantic analysis, optimization and code generation. For parsing and AST creation you will use ANTLR, which is the most popular tool for such purpose nowadays. Finally you will get understanding, what is going on between your high-level code and electrical impulses flowing in your computer.\nEven if you know all of these things (Java, Eclipse, git, Unit testing) it is still worth to take this class. You will apply your knowledge in practice and learn about compilers. This knowledge is useful not only to understand how computers work, but also to learn about algorithms and data structures, which are applied there.\nYou can find more information about CIS706 on compilers website. Moreover the StaticJava code is available on github: github.com/santoslab/compiler. There is also nice Compilers Course by Stanford University on Coursera, which can be used as supplement for this class.\n"

The end of semester (with compilers course&#39;s project), applying for a PhD studies, Christmas, New Year&#39;s eve in Poland, and a job interview. I will tell you more about all of those things later in separated posts. Maybe not all, Christmas and New Year&#39;s eve experience I will keep for myself :)\nI am happy that all above is accomplished and I can get back to my routine (programming, blogging, reading books and learning new things).\nIt is worth to summarize the last year, which was quite successful:\n\nI started Master of Science in Computer Science program at the Kansas State University.\nI started this blog.\nI created twitter account and started using it.\nI co-organized dotNetConfPL (with Michal Franc and Pawel Sawicz).\nI almost maintained 4.0 GPA (I have 3.8 for now).\nI applied for Microsoft Student Partner position, but Microsoft rejected me.\n\nThe main goals for this year are:\n\nGraduate with Master of Science degree from Kansas State University.\nStart a new job.\nRun dotNetConfPL 2014.\n\nI also would like to finally attend Dev Day conference in Kraków, but I am not sure if I will be in Poland on September 26.\nDuring &#39;the break&#39; I came up with a lot of ideas. I have 6 drafts for blog posts, 5 topics for a blog posts on the to do list and tons of &#39;new, cool things&#39; to check out. When you get busy, because of School, work, personal issues etc. - don&#39;t worry. Take a break, get all of more important things done and once you get back, you will be more happy and motivated than before.\n\n"

    "content"  : "Before you decide to upgrade your Windows 8 to 8.1, you should be aware of some issues/changes.\nTo begin with, it is not very obvious and easy to find a way, to avoid using Microsoft Account. Fortunately, Scott Hanselman described it in his blog, in his post How to sign into Windows 8 or 8.1 without a Microsoft account - make a local user.\nAnother issue is SkyDrive. If you are not using it, then you do not need to worry. But if you do (like me) then be aware that now it is integrated with Windows 8.1. You are not able to use SkyDrive app like in Windows 8. What is more: you need to sign in with Microsoft Account on Windows 8.1, to be able to use SkyDrive. In the recent version of SkyDrive, Microsoft introduced &quot;smart files&quot;. It distinguish two types of files: online-only (not stored on your hard drive and available when you are connected to the Internet) and offline (old-style files, can be used when you are offline and will be synced once you get online). Default status of new created file is online-only. You need to change it if you want to use files in the old-way (offline). There are two ways to do that. First: go to SkyDrive app and mark file/directory you want to make offline (by right click) and click &quot;Make offline&quot; in app bar:\n\nSecond way is go to SkyDrive settings and set &quot;Access all files offline&quot; to &quot;On&quot;:\n\nYou can find more details about &quot;smart files&quot; here.\nAll above issues are fixable. However there are a few things, which cannot be solved (so far). I have ThinkPad X220 (i5@2.3GHz, 8GB RAM, 160GB SSD) and I did a system upgrade from Win8 to Win8.1. Since then, the performance is a little bit worse. Additionally, I have two monitors connected through VGA and DisplayPort. The second monitor is all gray right after system boot. I need to click WIN+D to get the desktop. I do not have this issue on my PC where I installed Win 8.1 from scratch.\nI use PowerShell as my default command line. There is a weird issue with Lucidia Console font on Windows 8.1. You cannot set it as default font. It is not a huge concern, because the Consolas works fine, but I cannot use Lucidia Console (which I like better). More about this issue here.\nNow, let&#39;s look at the bright side of life. My favorite Windows 8.1 feature is &quot;search everywhere&quot;. You do not need to think whether you want to search programs (WIN+Q), settings (WIN+W) or files (WIN+F). However, Everything Search Engine is still the best for searching files.\nI like the Windows button too. After right-click, you have the same menu which you get with WIN+X. Furthermore, there are options shutdown/restart/sleep there. It is easier and faster accessible than &quot;Mouse to right-bottom corner of screen&quot;-&amp;gt;Settings-&amp;gt;Power-&amp;gt;Shut down.\nAnother nice feature is the adjustable size of tiles:\n\nTo learn about other new features I recommend Scott Hanselman&#39;s videos about new features in Windows 8.1. He is showing how to be productive on Windows 8.1 and how to take advantage of key shortcuts.\nBy the way: Happy New Year 2014!\n\n"

    "content"  : "Windows PowerShell is very powerful tool. It contains many useful commands. One of my favorite features is possibility to use some well-known bash commands such as: ls or pwd, which are missing in Windows Command Prompt. The cool thing is the fact, that PowerShell contains combination of Windows Command Prompt and Bash shell commands. E.g. for copying you can use copy (Windows) and cp (Bash). \nYou can also have personal configuration file (like .bashrc in Unix) to set some persistent settings. To find out, where it is located use command:\nPS C:\\&amp;gt; echo $PROFILE\nC:\\Users\\jj09\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1\nI needed to create directory &#39;WindowsPowerShell&#39; and profile file before adding some custom settings. Additionally, I needed to enable scripts on my system (it is disabled by default).\nPS C:\\&amp;gt; Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\nMore info about Execution Policies can be found here.\nMy Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 file:\n[shell]set-alias subl &amp;quot;C:\\Program Files\\Sublime Text 2\\sublime_text.exe&amp;quot;\nset-alias grep select-string\nset-alias ssh New-PSSecureRemoteSession\nset-alias sh New-PSRemoteSession\nset-alias l ls[/shell]\nThere is also &#39;Power&#39; version of PowerShell called ISE (Integrated Scripting Environment). Be aware, that it has different profile file (for me it is: C:\\Users\\jj09\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Microsoft.PowerShellISE_profile.ps1). You can check it with the same command like for standard PowerShell (echo $PROFILE). Here is a list of top 10 killer features, which are in ISE, but not in standard PS (Intellisense is my favorite).\n\nDisadvantage of PowerShell is its loading time. Windows Command prompt loads instantaneously, but PS need ~1 second. It is even worse in case of ISE, which needs ~3 seconds (on my Thinkpad X220: i5/8GB/SSD).\nYou can add custom configuration to Windows Command Prompt too. To do that you need to run command prompt with some arguments.\n"

I remember when I had microcontrollers class at Wroclaw University of Technology (about 3 years ago) and we were programming in Assembly. When I heard (3 years ago) that the main language for programming microcontrollers is C++ I was so excited. It would be so much easier than in Assembly. Now (3 years later), I started working on my Master Thesis at Kansas State University. The ultimate goal is to create prototype of medical device using embedded computer BeagleBoard XM.\nThis board has 1GHz ARM processor (Cortex-A8), 512MB RAM, 4 USB ports and even HDMI output. Moreover, it has MicroSD slot which allows you to run Linux or Android Operating system!\n\nThere is also Ethernet port, which allows to update the Operating System without any external PC. The key part of the device is set of PWM pins, which will allow me to control the medical device engine.\nI will use Ada programming language with cross-compiler from AdaCore. However you can install Java VM and run Java programs if you want! It blows my mind! Programming microcontrollers in Java (the very high-level programming language) instead of doing it in Assembly.\nThe cost of this Board is $149, which is another advantage of this device.\nMore info about the board can be found here.\nIt usually comes along with MicroSD card and Angstrom Linux on it. Additionally, you can find Angstrom images here. To update existing installation (of Angstrom) just do \nopkg update\nopkg upgrade\nMore info about OPKG Package Manager (Angstrom&#39;s Package Manager) can be found here.\n"

During this class, we are building a compiler for subset version of Java language. Homeworks looks like that: you get requirements and unit tests. Your score depends on number of passed tests. If all passed - you get 100%. \nFor development we use Java, JUnit and eclipse. To generate parser and lexer we use ANTLRWorks. The workflow is classic TDD style: you run tests, then try to fix bugs (e.g. your grammar) and run tests again. \nYesterday I spent almost 1 hour because I couldn&#39;t rerun tests. When I clicked run, they started and...nothing. I needed to terminate, then tried again, but still nothing. Even the fundamental solution for all kinds of problems with your machine - turning it off and on again - didn&#39;t help. I was trying to clean and build project, even remove .metadata directory. Still nothing.\nFinally, I started debugging JUnit tests and I noticed, that it hangs on call to parser class generated by ANTLR. I removed it, regenerated...and run the tests! What happend? Debbuging in ANTLRWorks (which I did) locks or do some magic with generated files. That means: after each time you debug in ANTLRWorks, you need to regenerate parser/lexer. \n"

    "content"  : "It is all about people and cooperation!\nLong story short\nApril 25-26 - dotNetConf took place, online conference for .NET developers, organized by Scott Hanselman and Javier Lozano\nApril 27 - I text Pawel Sawicz, that we can organize something similar with Polish speakers and name it dotNetConfPL, he said: &quot;it&#39;s a good idea&quot;. (motivation++)\nApril 28 - Pawel told me that Michal Franc is also interested and we created google doc to write down ideas and todos. (motivation++)\nMay 24 - We ask Scott Hanselman whether we can use dotNetConfPL as a name of the conference (because it&#39;s very similar to name of his conference). He and Javier Lozano confirmed in the same day and wished us good luck. (motivation++)\nJune 6 - We sent e-mail to Maciej Aniserowicz, with a proposition to be a speaker at our conference.\nJune 7 - He responded: yes (we had first speaker!). (motivation++)\nAfter that, we were inviting rest of speakers and most of them accepted our invitations. We really appreciate this, because they didn&#39;t get any benefits from that.\nJuly 14 - We announced dotNetConfPL on facebook and gain almost 50 registrations for the event within 1 hour! (motivation++)\nThe week of the conference\nA few days before the conference we did initial testing with speakers. To check, whether their microphone, resolution, etc. is set properly. Sometimes we had issues with Google Hangouts. Solution for that was simply disconnect and create a new &#39;hangout&#39;. Our initial plan was to make only 1 hangout for entire conference, because each one has different link. We wanted to avoid forcing people to refresh the website or use of SignalR. However after that, we decided it will be better (safer and more flexible) to create separate &#39;hangouts&#39; for each speaker and update link using SignalR.\nWebsite for conference was created in ASP.NET MVC framework. The SignalR+CounchDB feature was implemented day before conference. After the conference I found interesting file in our solution:\n\nIt is worth to mention that during the conference I was in Manhattan, KS, while Pawel and Michal were in Wroclaw, Poland. The image below, is my Command Center. ThinkPad X220 is connected with 2 monitors and through it I am connected to speakers. On MacBook I am connected via Skype with Michal and Pawel. On Surface I have live streaming (about 30 seconds delay) to be sure everything is working fine. The only issue I had, was not enough ears. I had only two: in one I was connected to the speaker, second - Michal and Pawel, and if I had third, I would be able to track the live streaming :)\n\nSessions\nAll sessions were in Polish. If you don&#39;t speak Polish, you can mute the sound, play this in background and watch :) You won&#39;t get full experience, but still can get a lot from each session!\nWhat is cool, all of them are for beginners and non-beginners in the same time. Which means, everybody will learn something from each session. Additionally: all of them are in HD (720p). Google enabled it by the end of August.\nMaciej Aniserowicz: Unit testing in .NET\nMaciej shows TDD live example. From nothing to well-tested communication with external API.\n\nFilip Wojcieszyn: scriptcs - C# on diet\nFilip shows how to use C# in Console and/or in SublimeText.\n\nJakub Gutkowski: JavaScript for C# developer\nJakub shows differences between C# and JavaScript, and language flavors every developer should be aware of, which may cause hard to track bugs.\n\nTomasz Janczuk: Node.js, Edge.js and Windows Azure\nThis session blew my mind (and not only mine). Edge.js allows you to mix Node.js, C#, F#, IronPython, PowerShell and T-SQL code in one file!\n\nMaciej Grabek: Windows Phone 8 Tips &amp;amp; Tricks\nMaciej shows set of useful(8) tricks for WP8 developers. From displaying helper-grid during development, to how to get more ratings for your app. \n\nSummary\nEverything went well. We didn&#39;t have any problems with streaming (thanks Google Hangouts) and website (thanks Windows Azure and SignalR). I noticed that sometimes, on my Surface RT, IE11 wasn&#39;t refreshing the link. But, come on...it&#39;s IE, so we can ignore it :)\nWe had room on JabbR for discussion and ask questions to speakers. For a few minutes, even David Fowler (one of SignalR developers) visited it.\nI am very glad that many people attended the conference. We had more than 600 registrations, almost 100 people in JabbR room and around 100-200 online viewers. But many people were watching the conference together, and in this case 1 online viewer = more that 1 physical viewers.\n\n\n\n\nThank you very much for all speakers! You did a great job guys, all sessions are international level!\nThanks to Michal and Pawel for organizing this conference with me.\nThanks to Scott Hanselman and Javier Lozano for inspiration.\nAnd...thank you very much for all of you who were watching the conference and spreading the news!\nEDIT:\nShort list of tools/technologies we were using for the conference:\n\nGoogle Hangouts\nASP.NET MVC\nSignalR\nCouchDB\nWindows Azure (to be able to scale the instance, depends on the number of users)\nGoogle Docs (as a database for most important information)\nTrello (for tasks management)\nAppHarbor (as test server)\n\n"

We can say that it is a lightweight web server for .NET. In fact, it is more than that (more info here).\nDemo\nFirst, we need to create application project. Let&#39;s create &#39;Empty Web Application&#39; (it might be also Console App).\n\nNext, we will install two NuGet packages (using Package Manager Console):\nInstall-Package Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb\nInstall-Package Owin.Extensions\nThen, we need to create &#39;Startup class&#39;.\n[csharp]\nusing System;\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Web;\nusing Owin;\nnamespace OwinDemo\n{\n    public class Startup\n    {\n        public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)\n        {\n            app.UseHandlerAsync((req, res) =&amp;gt;\n            {\n                res.ContentType = &amp;quot;text/plain&amp;quot;;\n                return res.WriteAsync(&amp;quot;Hello Katana!&amp;quot;);\n            });\n        }\n    }\n}\n[/csharp]\nNow we are ready to run our web server, but you may get following error:\n\nFortunately there is easy fix for that.

With scriptcs I can finally do that in console. Project scriptcs allows you to run single commands and also C# script files.\nInstallation\nThe easiest way to install scriptcs is Chocolatey (&#39;apt-get&#39; for windows). If you didn&#39;t hear about it, you should definitely try it out. To install Chocolatey run the following command in console:\n@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command &quot;iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString(&#39;https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1&#39;))&quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; SET PATH=%PATH%;%systemdrive%\\chocolatey\\bin\nOnce you have Chocolatey installed, you can install scriptcs:\ncinst scriptcs\nChocolatey will install scriptcs to %APPDATA%\\scriptcs\\. You need to update your PATH accordingly, to easily run it from command line.\nGetting started\nOnce scriptcs is installed and added to your PATH, you can run it with scriptcs command:\nC:\\&amp;gt; scriptcs\nscriptcs (ctrl-c or blank to exit)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;gt; var message = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;\n&amp;gt; Console.WriteLine(message);\nHello, world!\n&amp;gt; \nC:\\&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;\nYou can also create a script hello.csx:\n[csharp]var message = &amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot;;\nConsole.WriteLine(message);[/csharp]\nAnd run it from command line:\nC:\\&amp;gt;scriptcs hello.csx\nHello, world!\nYou can find more about scriptcs on scriptcs.net.\nEDIT: You don&#39;t even need Console.WriteLine to print variables (thanks Filip W.):\nC:\\&amp;gt;scriptcs\nscriptcs (ctrl-c or blank to exit)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;gt; var message = &quot;Hello, scriptcs!&quot;;\n&amp;gt; message\nHello, scriptcs!\n&amp;gt; int four = 2 + 2;\n&amp;gt; four\n4\n&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;\n\n"

And I was right.\n\nThe Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles is written by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, who are University Professors. They created course based on this book (or wrote this book based on their course :)). The first 6 (out of 12) chapters are available for free at course website.\nWhy every programmer should read this book? Because it allows you to understand how computer works. It is going from logic gates, through machine code, intermediate code, compilers etc., to high level programming language. At the end of each chapter, there are exercises in which you are &#39;building&#39; parts of the computer.\nThis book has only 344 pages and of course it doesn&#39;t cover all details. Each chapter is kind of basic overview, however it is sufficient to get the idea and basic understanding before you go more deeply (e.g. into Computer Architecture or Compilers).\nI really enjoyed reading this book. It is amazing how all those things we are doing everyday on our machines are done just by adding, subtracting, comparing and copying sequences of zeros and ones.\nThe book is available at amazon. There is also a website with more information about it (e.g. 10 minutes overview video), and software created for exercises (which you can find at the end of each chapter).\n"

    "content"  : "A rich Internet application (RIA) is a Web application that has many of the characteristics of desktop application software.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\nWe used to create Rich Internet Applications in Silverlight. Now, JavaScript frameworks (e.g. Knockout, Angular) are getting more popular for such purpose. Everything because of HTML5, which combined with them can easily provide nice development environment and rich experience.\nHowever, all of those frameworks just take advantage of AJAX calls. So, what&#39;s big deal? \nThere is a few reasons. First one is the fact, that HTML5 data-* attribute allows to bind variables to HTML elements. We do not need to select them using id or class attributes. Another reason is variety of frameworks, which makes all of those AJAX calls behind the scenes. Additionally they do lot of other work such us serializing, models binding etc. They are just higher level of abstraction than jQuery.\nKnockoutJS\nOne of the most popular JavaScript Framework is Knockout. It applies MVVM pattern. Its key features are:\n\nDeclarative bindings (easily associate HTML elements with model)\nAutomatic UI Refresh (when data changes)\nDependency Tracking (chains of relationships)\nTemplating (easily generates UI depends on model data types) - e.g. we can use for loops in HTML\n\nKnockoutJS is open source framework, created by Steve Sanderson.\nIf you want to get started with SPA I recommend you knockoutjs.com website and John Papa&#39;s series at Pluralsight.net:  Building HTML5 and JavaScript Apps with MVVM and Knockout and  Single Page Apps JumpStart (in this course John is taking advantage of various JS libraries to create consistent Single Page Appliation). \nThe biggest advantage of all JS libraries from my point of view is the possibility to do more (functionalities) with less (code). In other words: avoid rewriting boilerplate code.\nEDIT: You should also check John Papa&#39;s HotTowel project template for Visual Studio, which gives you great start point for building SPA. It contains many JS libraries (e.g. Knockout and Durandal) for Rich Internet Apps development. More info on John&#39;s blog. Thanks to nilphilus and Piotr Ptak for mentioning about it in comments.\n"

Off course the state of progress bar was dependent on the other thread. It had to be updated after each subtask call. This is the code:\n[python]import threading\nimport time\nimport gtk\ndef init_progressbar():\n    main_box = gtk.VBox()\n    progressbar = gtk.ProgressBar()\n    progressbar_box = gtk.HBox(False, 20)\n    main_box.pack_start(progressbar_box, False, False, 20)\n    progressbar_box.pack_start(progressbar)\n    info_box = gtk.VBox()\n    main_box.pack_start(info_box, False, False, 10)\n    info_label = gtk.Label(&amp;quot;Running...&amp;quot;)\n    info_box.pack_start(info_label)\n    return main_box, progressbar, info_label\ndef run_tasks(pb, info_label):\n    task_list = [&#39;task1&#39;, &#39;task2&#39;, &#39;task3&#39;, &#39;task4&#39;]\n    task_no = 0\n    for task in task_list:\n        pb.set_fraction(float(task_no)/len(task_list))\n        run_task(2, task, info_label)\n        task_no += 1\n    pb.set_fraction(float(task_no)/len(task_list))\n    info_label.set_text(&#39;Finished&#39;)\ndef run_task(delay, task, info_label):\n    info_label.set_text(task + &#39; is running...&#39;)\n    time.sleep(delay)   # simulation of running the task\nwin_pb, pb, info_label = init_progressbar()\nwin = gtk.Window()\nwin.set_default_size(400,100)\nwin.add(win_pb)\nwin.show_all()\nwin.connect(&amp;quot;destroy&amp;quot;, lambda _: gtk.main_quit())\nt = threading.Thread(target=run_tasks, args=(pb,info_label))\nt.start()\ngtk.main()\n[/python]\nAnd...it was not working. The progress bar (and the label) did not get updated after task calls. Why?\nIt was caused by the fact, that PyGTK is not thread safe. Fortunately we have function threads_init() in gobject module, which can handle it. We just need to call gobject.threads_init() before first thread creation. Corrected (working) code looks like that:\n[python]import threading\nimport time\nimport gobject\nimport gtk\ndef init_progressbar():\n    main_box = gtk.VBox()\n    progressbar = gtk.ProgressBar()\n    progressbar_box = gtk.HBox(False, 20)\n    main_box.pack_start(progressbar_box, False, False, 20)\n    progressbar_box.pack_start(progressbar)\n    info_box = gtk.VBox()\n    main_box.pack_start(info_box, False, False, 10)\n    info_label = gtk.Label(&amp;quot;Running...&amp;quot;)\n    info_box.pack_start(info_label)\n    return main_box, progressbar, info_label\ndef run_tasks(pb, info_label):\n    task_list = [&#39;task1&#39;, &#39;task2&#39;, &#39;task3&#39;, &#39;task4&#39;]\n    task_no = 0\n    gobject.threads_init()\n    for task in task_list:\n        pb.set_fraction(float(task_no)/len(task_list))\n        run_task(2, task, info_label)\n        task_no += 1\n    pb.set_fraction(float(task_no)/len(task_list))\n    info_label.set_text(&#39;Finished&#39;)\ndef run_task(delay, task, info_label):\n    info_label.set_text(task + &#39; is running...&#39;)\n    time.sleep(delay)   # simulation of running the task\nwin_pb, pb, info_label = init_progressbar()\nwin = gtk.Window()\nwin.set_default_size(400,100)\nwin.add(win_pb)\nwin.show_all()\nwin.connect(&amp;quot;destroy&amp;quot;, lambda _: gtk.main_quit())\nt = threading.Thread(target=run_tasks, args=(pb,info_label))\nt.start()\ngtk.main()\n[/python]\nI wanted also to be able to cancel program computation, by the cancel button. To do that I needed shared variable to be a status flag informing, whether computation should be cancelled or continued. It had to be accessible in task loop and cancel event. \nIn Python there are mutable and immutable objects. Mutable are passed by reference, but immutable - by value. More about that on this StackOverflow question. Boolean type is immutable, but there is a way around this: use list (mutable type) with one element (boolean variable). I know it is awful solution, but I did not find any better. If you know one, let me know!\nThis is the app with cancel button:\n[python]import threading\nimport time\nimport gobject\nimport gtk\ndef init_progressbar():\n    main_box = gtk.VBox()\n    progressbar = gtk.ProgressBar()\n    progressbar_box = gtk.HBox(False, 20)\n    main_box.pack_start(progressbar_box, False, False, 20)\n    progressbar_box.pack_start(progressbar)\n    info_box = gtk.VBox()\n    main_box.pack_start(info_box, False, False, 10)\n    info_label = gtk.Label(&amp;quot;Running...&amp;quot;)\n    info_box.pack_start(info_label)\n    cancel_box = gtk.HBox()\n    info_box.pack_start(cancel_box)\n    cancel_button = gtk.Button(&amp;quot;Cancel&amp;quot;)\n    cancel = [False]\n    cancel_button.connect(&amp;quot;clicked&amp;quot;, cancel_counting, info_label, cancel)\n    cancel_box.pack_start(cancel_button, False, False, 20)\n    return main_box, progressbar, info_label, cancel\ndef run_tasks(pb, info_label, cancel):\n    task_list = [&#39;task1&#39;, &#39;task2&#39;, &#39;task3&#39;, &#39;task4&#39;]\n    task_no = 0\n    gobject.threads_init()\n    for task in task_list:\n        if cancel[0]:\n            pb.set_fraction(0)\n            info_label.set_text(&#39;Canceled&#39;)\n            return\n        pb.set_fraction(float(task_no)/len(task_list))\n        run_task(2, task, info_label)\n        task_no += 1\n    pb.set_fraction(float(task_no)/len(task_list))\n    info_label.set_text(&#39;Finished&#39;)\ndef run_task(delay, task, info_label):\n    info_label.set_text(task + &#39; is running...&#39;)\n    time.sleep(delay)   # simulation of running the task\ndef cancel_counting(widget, info_label, cancel):\n    cancel[0] = True\n    info_label.set_text(&amp;quot;Cancelling...&amp;quot;)\nwin_pb, pb, info_label, cancel = init_progressbar()\nwin = gtk.Window()\nwin.set_default_size(400,100)\nwin.add(win_pb)\nwin.show_all()\nwin.connect(&amp;quot;destroy&amp;quot;, lambda _: gtk.main_quit())\nt = threading.Thread(target=run_tasks, args=(pb,info_label, cancel))\nt.start()\ngtk.main()\n[/python]\nTo make above code working on your machine you need to have Python and PyGTK installed.

    "content"  : "\nFinally I read book written by Andrew Hunt and Dave Thomas: The Pragmatic Programmer. It was published in 1999, but it is still valid. The main idea provided by this book is the way of thinking. In other words: how &#39;The Pragmatic Programmer&#39; should behave and what actions he should take in various situations.\nThere are also tips which skills are useful for programmer (e.g. using perl/bash scripts, mastering command line and at least one text editor).\nSome advices are not valid in any case. E.g. in my opinion tip to never leave broken functionality has exceptions. Especially when it is some minor bug. There are situations when it is better to first focus on most important features and the problematic one leave for the end. After all we will have a few minor bugs and working main functionality. Instead of solved some or even only one, hard minor bug (like css styling:)) and not implemented main functionalities.\nThe other well-known (or should be well-known) tips like use Source Control, learn new technologies, analyze mistakes from past projects are also mentioned and described.\nHere you can find list of tips from the book in nutshell: http://pragprog.com/the-pragmatic-programmer/extracts/tips. It is kind of summary of the book content.\nAt the and of each chapter, there is a set of exercises. This one blew my mind:\nA quick reality check. Which of these &quot;impossible&quot; things can happen?\n\nA month with fewer than 28 days.\nstat(&quot;.&quot; ,&amp;amp;sb) == -1 (that is, can&#39;t access the current directory)\nIn C++: a=2;b=3; if (a+b!=5) exit(l);\nA triangle with an interior angle sum != 180°\nA minute that doesn&#39;t have 60 seconds\nIn Java: (a + 1) &amp;lt;= a\n\n\nFortunately at the end of the book there are answers (I wouldn&#39;t even start googling, due to 100% certainty that some of them just can not happen, like 1 or 5):\n\n\nSeptember, 1752 had only 19 days. This was done\nto synchronize calendars as part of the Gregorian\nReformation.\nThe directory could have been removed by another\nprocess, you might not have permission to read it,\n&amp;amp;sb might be invalid—you get the picture.\nWe sneakily didn&#39;t specify the types of a and b.\nOperator overloading might have defined +, =, or !\n= to have unexpected behavior. Also, a and b may\nbe aliases for the same variable, so the second\nassignment will overwrite the value stored in the first.\nIn non-Euclidean geometry, the sum of the angles of\na triangle will not add up to 180°. Think of a triangle\nmapped on the surface of a sphere.\nLeap minutes may have 61 or 62 seconds.\nOverflow may leave the result of a + 1 negative (this\ncan also happen in C and C++).\n\n\nSummarizing: The Pragmatic Programmer contains huge amount of tips, which can help you to become better programmer. You may already know some of them (or most of them). In that case you will recall why they are important. Even Scott Hanselman said on his blog (in post Six Essential Language Agnostic Programming Books), that he &#39;like to read this book at least every six months or so&#39;.\nIt is 352 pages book. Can be easily read within 2 weeks by 1 hour reading per day. In my opinion it is one of must-read for programmer.\n"

It is focused on toolset for analyzing Spark/Ada programs: Bakar. Spark is subset of Ada programming language extended by code contracts. More info here. Bakar contains two main tools: Alir (information flow analysis tool) and Kiasan (verification tool for code contracts). \nThe Kiasan tool is based on symbolic execution. Simply saying: it checks all possible code paths and discover possible issues (like variable overflow, side effects etc.). More info about Spark contracts can be found in Tokeneer Discovery Tutorial. Comprehensive description of Kiasan in contained in this paper.\nKiasan plugin for GPS\nMy first task was to integrate Kiasan tool (Java app) with GPS (GNAT Programming Studio). \nI have never working on IDE plugins before. It was something totally new for me. That&#39;s why I was excited.\nPlugins for GPS are written in PyGTK (Python graphic library). First I needed to learn Python and PyGTK. Then I followed GPS documentation (especially chapters 16 and 18).\nThe sample flow of running Kiasan plugin is as follows:\n\nright click on method (which you want to analyze) and choose &#39;Run Kiasan&#39;\nhandle this event and get method name and package name (will be needed to run Kiasan)\nrun external Java program (Kiasan.jar) from Python code (it has command line interface, so I just needed to execute subprocess.call method), which generates JSON report\nparse JSON report and display it in the PyGTK window attached to the GPS\nadd code highlighting, dependent on chosen method or case (in report window by double-click)\n\nGPS along with Kiasan plugin is available in Sireum distribution, which can be downloaded from http://www.sireum.org/download.\nIn the demo below I am showing how to install Sireum distribution and GPS with Kiasan plugin on Windows.\n\nBy the way: Sireum Project is Open Source on github!\nDo I like GRA job? Yes. It is very nice experience. I am able to work on Mac. I didn&#39;t have this opportunity before (I wouldn&#39;t buy it soon probably). I was able to learn Python (and PyGTK). I learn Design by Contract. I learn how to create plugin for IDE (GNAT Programming Studio). We have continues integration server - Jenkins: I learn how to manage it. I explore the World of &#39;High Assurance Software&#39; and Ada programming language, which is most common in such environment. It is totally different than working as software developer in some company. \nRecently I started working on second SAnToS&#39; project: Medical Device Coordination Framework. Another interesting thing. But I will tell you about it in another post.\nInteresting fact: Ada programming language was named after Ada Lovelace (1815–1852), who is credited as being the first computer programmer.\n"

This is &#39;configuration over convention&#39;, instead of &#39;convention over configuration&#39; as it is in Ruby on Rails or ASP.NET MVC.\nAs an example, look at this piece of xml, which is needed to handle JSON and XML requests (all written by hand):\n[xml]&amp;lt;bean class=&amp;quot;org.springframework.web.servlet.view.ContentNegotiatingViewResolver&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\n\t\t&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;order&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;\n\t\t&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;contentNegotiationManager&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t&amp;lt;bean class=&amp;quot;org.springframework.web.accept.ContentNegotiationManager&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;constructor-arg&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;bean class=&amp;quot;org.springframework.web.accept.PathExtensionContentNegotiationStrategy&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;constructor-arg&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;map&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;entry key=&amp;quot;json&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;application/json&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;entry key=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;application/xml&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;/map&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;/constructor-arg&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;/constructor-arg&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;\n\t\t&amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;\n\t\t&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;defaultViews&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t&amp;lt;list&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;bean class=&amp;quot;org.springframework.web.servlet.view.json.MappingJacksonJsonView&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;bean class=&amp;quot;org.springframework.web.servlet.view.xml.MarshallingView&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;constructor-arg&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;bean class=&amp;quot;org.springframework.oxm.xstream.XStreamMarshaller&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;autodetectAnnotations&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;/constructor-arg&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t\t&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;\n\t\t\t&amp;lt;/list&amp;gt;\n\t\t&amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;\n\t&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;[/xml]\nGoing back to controller: besides its configuration in XML file, we need to add annotation @Controller on its class and @RequestMapping on methods (no default routing). Additionally we always need to return the name of view (instead of some default value). Here is a sample controller with one action:\n[java]@Controller\npublic class HelloWorldController {\n    @RequestMapping(&amp;quot;/helloWorld&amp;quot;)\n    public String helloWorld(Model model) {\n        model.addAttribute(&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Hello World!&amp;quot;);\n        return &amp;quot;helloWorld&amp;quot;;\n    }\n}[/java]\nAbove code will return the view helloWorld.jsp (according to convention, located in webapp/WEB-INF/jsp/ directory):\n[html]&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;\n        Message: ${message}\n    &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;[/html]\nThe result should looks like that:\n\nConnecting application with database is not easier. Adding dependencies and writing code to make Hibernate working with the app took 1h(!) in Pluralsight tutorial (Spring with JPA and Hibernate). It is over 50 lines of xml. Additionally as we know - it is very easy to make a mistake during writing xml. In ASP.NET MVC it can be done automatically (eventually we can change data source by specifying connection string). I didn&#39;t find easier way to do that (in Spring). Of course we can use copy/paste method and just set some properties, but...where is code generation for that?\nAfter all, I would like to notice how big step was made by other MVC Web Frameworks like Rails, Django or ASP.NET MVC. Lot of stuff, which has to be written by hand in Spring, is already implemented under framework layer (in Rails, Django and ASP.NET MVC). However Spring MVC was also big step ahead, when it was created in 2002. In this video people are explaining that (e.g. because of Spring they do not need to rewrite lots of boilerplate code anymore). \nI wonder whether next version of Spring MVC will have more &#39;conventions&#39; and default configurations. It will make the framework more developer friendly and easier to maintain.\nIf you want to start with Spring MVC i recommend you to start with Pluralsight.net tutorials: Introduction to Spring MVC and Spring with JPA and Hibernate. You can also find this website useful, as well as Spring Framework Reference Documentation. I didn&#39;t read any book, but I found those two most often recommended: Spring Recipes and Spring in Action.\n"

    "content"  : "Warning: this configuration was tested only on MacOS X.\nTo create default project in Rails we just need to run command:\nrails new my_app \nHowever it creates project without many useful gems. I found nice Gem-set and some configuration hacks in Michael Hartl&#39;s tutorial.\nInstead of standard test framework (TestUnit) he use RSpec (which is more popular among Rails developers). To generate project without standard test, run command:\nrails new my_app --skip-test-unit \nThen use his Gemfile (this link is kept up to date). Copy it a paste into my_app/Gemfile. I recommend to uncomment everything (to use all Gems from the file).\nOnce Gemfile is modified, you need to install gems:\nbundle install\nThen you can run RSpec test:\nbundle exec rspec \nYou may need to point the tests&#39; directory:\nbundle exec rspec rspec/ \nIt would be nice to run them with just &#39;rspec&#39; command. To do that we need to run following commands (if we used RVM to install Rails):\nrvm get head &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rvm reload \ncd ~/projects/my_app \nbundle install --without production --binstubs=./bundler_stubs \nAfter those steps you should be able to run RSpec with:\nrspec \nYou should get a warning, that to maintain this possibility you need to add following line to ~/.bash_profile if it exists, otherwise add it to ~/.bash_login:\nsource ~/.profile \nMichael Hartl&#39;s Gem file contains &#39;guard&#39;. It allows us to run RSpec test each time, when we change some file (after save). \nTo initialize guard (if all above steps are performed, otherwise you need to add &#39;bundle exec &#39; at the beginning):\nguard init \nIt creates Guardfile in main project directory, which specify when tests should be run (which files should be monitored). To run guard:\nguard \nThe last improvement is use the test server Spork. It allows to run tests faster. Without Spork, RSpec needs to reload entire Rails environment before run the tests (in each run). Spork loads the environment once, and then maintains a pool of processes for running future tests. Unfortunately it works only on POSIX systems (which means: doesn&#39;t work on Windows).\nTo setup spork run:\nspork --bootstrap\nThen change spec/spec_helper.rb file to something like that:\n[ruby]require &#39;rubygems&#39;\nrequire &#39;spork&#39;\nSpork.prefork do\n  ENV[&amp;quot;RAILS_ENV&amp;quot;] ||= &#39;test&#39;\n  require File.expand_path(&amp;quot;../../config/environment&amp;quot;, __FILE__)\n  require &#39;rspec/rails&#39;\n  require &#39;rspec/autorun&#39;\n  Dir[Rails.root.join(&amp;quot;spec/support/**/*.rb&amp;quot;)].each {|f| require f}\n  RSpec.configure do |config|\n    config.mock_with :rspec\n    config.fixture_path = &amp;quot;#{::Rails.root}/spec/fixtures&amp;quot;\n    config.use_transactional_fixtures = true\n    config.infer_base_class_for_anonymous_controllers = false\n  end\nend\nSpork.each_run do\n  # This code will be run each time you run your specs.\nend[/ruby]\nYou also need to configure RSpec to automatically use Spork. To do that, modify .rspec file:\n[code]--color\n--drb[/code]\nTo run Spork:\nspork\nYou can test difference between running tests with and without spork.\ntime rspec\nIn my case it was 4.821s without Spork, and 0.784 with Spork.\nThe disadvantage of Spork is that after e.g. changes in database we need to restart it. \nThe screencast showing advanced setup by Michael Hartl is available for free here. If you use SublimeText (as I do), you can follow this screencast to adjust it for Rails development. After that you will be able even to run tests from SublimeText!\n"

    "content"  : "It took me a while to configure sending email from Rails application. I went through many different tutorials, blogs, StackOverflow posts etc. Step, by step I found working configuration.\nTo send emails I use ActionMailer. First you need to generate mailer:\nrails generate mailer UserMailer\nIt will create UserMailer class in app/mailers directory. In this class we need to define our method for sending emails:\n[ruby]class UserMailer &amp;lt; ActionMailer::Base\n  default from: &amp;quot;from@example.com&amp;quot;\n  def send_email(user_email, content)\n  \t@user_email = user_email\n  \t@content = content\n  \tmail(to: &amp;quot;your@mail.com&amp;quot;, subject: &amp;quot;Email from mysite.com&amp;quot;)\n  end\nend[/ruby]\nThen in the directory app/views/user_mailer we need to create template for our email: send_email.html.erb (this name must match the name of action created in UserMailer class):\n[html]&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;meta content=&#39;text/html; charset=UTF-8&#39; http-equiv=&#39;Content-Type&#39; /&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n      From: &amp;lt;%= @user_email %&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n      &amp;lt;%= @content %&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;[/html]\n(*) If you do not want to send html you can create plain text and name file send_email.text.erb.\nNow, the hardest part. Configuration of smtp. You need to add it to config/environments/development.rb (or test.rb or production.rb). I found this configuration working for gmail:\n[ruby]# set delivery method to :smtp, :sendmail or :test\n  config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp\n  config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true\n  # these options are only needed if you choose smtp delivery\n  config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {\n    :address        =&amp;gt; &#39;smtp.gmail.com&#39;,\n    :port           =&amp;gt; 587,\n    :domain         =&amp;gt; &#39;gmail.com&#39;,\n    :authentication =&amp;gt; :login,\n    :user_name      =&amp;gt; &#39;your_gmail@gmail.com&#39;,\n    :password       =&amp;gt; &#39;your_password&#39;,\n    :enable_starttls_auto =&amp;gt; true\n  }[/ruby]\nThe last thing is call ActionMailer from our app:\n[ruby]UserMailer.send_email(params[:from], params[:content]).deliver[/ruby]\nForm for sending email can looks like that:\n[html]&amp;lt;%= form_tag &#39;/send_email&#39;, method: &#39;post&#39; do %&amp;gt;\n\t&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;field&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\n\t\tEmail&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;%= email_field_tag :from %&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n\t&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;field&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\n\t\tContent&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;%= text_area_tag :content, nil, rows: 10, cols: 25 %&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;actions&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\n    &amp;lt;%= submit_tag &amp;quot;Send&amp;quot;, class: &amp;quot;btn btn-large btn-primary&amp;quot; %&amp;gt;\n  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;% end %&amp;gt;[/html]\nFor that you need to configure action in controller and match route e.g.:\n[ruby]match &#39;/send_email&#39;, to: &#39;your_controller#your_action&#39;[/ruby]\nMethod send_mail (from UserMailer class) can have as much parameters as you need. It can be also 0. In above example, the params are just rendered in the email template (send_email.html.erb file).\n"

    "content"  : "\nRecently I decided to learn Ruby on Rails. When you start learning a new technology you are always looking for the best available materials (to learn as efficient as possible). I did the same (using Google and StackOverflow). Fortunately I found The Best Way to Learn Ruby on Rails and I followed the recommended steps. With small modifications (extensions). \nFirst of all I extended first step. Instead of just going through &quot;Try Ruby&quot; exercises I also read first chapter of Seven Languages in Seven Weeks (which is about Ruby). It was very good move, because this book is written in the way to show the flavors of language by comparison with others. I am a .NET guy, who was coding in PHP, C++, Java and Python before. Because of that I was more interested in the differences between Ruby and these languages, than in programming from ground up. I also reviewed (not read) Humble Little Ruby Book. It is a little bit more deep, but it gives you solid Ruby basics.\nI was working with Rails on Windows and on Mac. Installing on Windows is very easy when you use RubyInstaller. There is also version for Mac. However on Mac you can also install Rails using RVM. In that case I recommend you installation screncast by Michael Hartl.  On Windows I used RubyInstaller, but on Mac I took advantage of Michael Hartl&#39;s screencast. Additionally you may also need SQLite Database Browser to browse your database easily. I did not know about it at the beginning and I was using rails dbconsole. Browsing with SQLite Database Browser is much more comfortable!\nWhen I had Rails installed I went through Jeffrey’s Introduction to Rails. During that I tried to follow him, by writing code on my machine, but many times he was too fast. I needed to pausing video very often and even scrolling back to see written command (he was changing screens to quickly). Anyway it was very nice introduction and I recommend it. But you can skip rewriting and trying code he is writing. Just watch it to get a flavor of Rails.\nAfter that I went through Rails for Zombies tutorials. I was very lucky, because Code School had promotion in May 18-19, and they provided Rails for Zombies 2 for free in these days. These tutorials are very solid. The exercises force you to learn by typing, because you cannot proceed to next level, until you do not finish all tasks.\n\nWith all basics gained as described above I started a book: Agile Web Development with Rails. I really like this book. It has 3 parts:\n\nGetting started (Rails installation, create first app, quick Rails architecture overview)\nBuilding application (tutorial)\nRails in Depth\n\nThe longest part of the book is the tutorial(2nd). Through this part you are creating an complete application exploring different Rails features. Unfortunately this book is a little bit outdated. Authors use ruby version 1.8.7 and Rails 3.0.0. I installed most recent versions: ruby 1.9.3p392 and Rails 3.2.13. Sometimes you need to fix the code (e.g. Chapter 11 - Task F: Add a Dash of Ajax). During that I found Ruby on Rails documentation very useful. \nThe last part is going deep into Rails. I really recommend this part! It is not only about Rails, but also about Web Applications and MVC architecture in general: how browser works, how requests are handled by Rails app, session, cookies etc.\nWhen I was in the middle of book I was a little bit angry (because it is outdated) and I switched to Ruby on Rails tutorial by Michael Hartl, which is strongly recommended on StackOverflow. Well...guys at SO are right. This is really good piece of knowledge not only about Rails, but also about using git, css, Bootstrap and Web Development in general. I really enjoyed it! If you do not want to buy videos, you can just read the free book (it is the same content as in videos and more). There are also nice videos describing advanced setup for Rails development on Mac and SublimeText configuration for Rails. Actually this tutorial covers Rails development from A to Z. \nAs a summary to the book and Michael Hartl&#39;s tutorial I reviewed Rails Guides. It is a nice overview for most important rails features. Can be also used as a reference. Some of the RailsCasts are also useful.\nI wanted to try a few different tutorials/books to see different approaches. E.g. Michael Hartl use rspec for unit tests, but the authors of Agile Web Development with Rails are using rails testing framework.\nMy adventure with Ruby (on Rails) lasts almost two months. Now I can admit that ROR is a very powerful and developer friendly framework. It contains many features, which are already grabbed by ASP.NET (e.g. migrations, bundling). What was surprising for me, you do not need IDE to develop Rails apps. I use SublimeText2 (awesome editor!) and it is really enough. Some Rails developers use VIM or Emacs. Of course there are some IDEs such as RubyMine or Aptana Studio. I tried both. RubyMine seems to be pretty cool...but I stick with SublimeText. Additionally, during Rails development you spend lot of time with console (to create/run/undo migrations, create models/controllers, run tests etc.). \nIf you want to start Rails development, my recommended steps are:\n\nRead first chapter of Seven Languages in Seven Weeks (it&#39;s about Ruby)\nWatch Jeffrey’s Introduction to Rails (just watch it, without trying to follow him on your machine!)\nGo through Rails for Zombies tutorial\nInstall Rails: on Windows (RubyInstaller) or on Mac (Michael&#39;s Hartl installation guide)\nDo Ruby on Rails tutorial by Michael Hartl\nRead 3rd chapter of Agile Web Development with Rails (you can also read 1st and 2nd chapters, but its content is more or less covered by Michael Hartl&#39;s tutorial)\nCreate blog or some &quot;your idea Rails app&quot;\n\nYou might also find these tools/resources useful:\n\nRuby on Rails documentation\nSQLite Browser\nRails Guides\nRailsCasts\n\nWhat I like in Ruby on Rails? The syntax, convention over configuration and lots of implemented features in the framework layer. Moreover: Rails are just cool.\n"

One of recommended tools is PureText.\n\nIt allows to paste text from clipboard without formatting, by WIN+V. This shortcut can be changed in options.\nMy life is much easier right now.

    "content"  : "At the build conference (June 26-28, 2013) Microsoft announced Windows 8.1 Preview and Visual Studio 2013 Preview. I installed them on my Virtual Machine. Just in case, to protect my system from some unexpected features :)\nIn case of Windows 8.1 there are no big changes. Only some small, useful improvements. I like &#39;search all&#39;, which enables you to search within apps, settings and files in the same time. However I am still using Search Everything, because it&#39;s faster and more effective. It&#39;s also cool to have the Start button, which brings you to the metro desktop, but again - no big deal (I was ok with WIN button). You can find list of improvements/changes here and here.\nThe new Visual Studio is more interesting. The One ASP.NET idea is applied. When you create new project, there are only one template: &#39;ASP.NET Web Application&#39;. Then in second step, you can choose which types of applications you want to include into it.\n&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\nThere is MVC 5 (Preview) in it, along with various scaffolding options. You can e.g. scaffold just edit action.\nGreat feature for web developers: you can open page in multiple web browsers and then refresh them all from Visual Studio (e.g. after change in code).\nThe editors experience is improved. You can have code map in the scroll bar. HTML editor is rewritten from scratch. Short list of my favorite features:\n\nnew code snippets (in HTML document try: &#39;div.myClass*4&amp;gt;lorem&#39; and click TAB)\nintellisense in web.config\nALT + UP/DOWN - move code line up or down\nALT + 1/2 - extends text selection to level up or down\nALT+SHIFT+W - allows to surround selected text with new tag\nALT+V - voice commands (which shows shortcuts), yes we can speak to Visual Studio!\nJavaScript frameworks intellisense (e.g. AngularJS)\n\nBut the greatest news is: WebEssentials2013 are now Open Source on github. Everyone can contribute. The policy is to add experimental features to WebEssentials and then move the hottest to Visual Studio (once they are tested). To see all, new, hot features watch Mads Kristensen&#39;s talk at build 2013.\nAnother cool thing is possibility to &#39;sign in&#39; in the Visual Studio. Once you sign in using your Microsoft account, you can synchronize settings across your devices. Now, it is enough to customize you Visual Studio only once.\nThere is much more new features. You can find them here and here.\n"

A month before giving the lecture, Pausch had received a prognosis that the pancreatic cancer, with which he had been diagnosed a year earlier, was terminal. Despite this, he didn&#39;t lose optimistic life approach. His last lecture is about achieving childhood dreams and...you just need to see it! I promise: you won&#39;t regret it!\n\nThe lecture took place at Carnegie Mellon on September 18, 2007. Randy Pausch died on July 25th, 2008.

Now we can edit Word documents, play games and even use IDE in Web Browser. I am not saying that it will be no classic Mobile apps at all, but e.g. apps like Calendar, gmail, Evernote, OneNote or games should be easilly accessible through Mobile Web Browser. The advantage of that would be lack of necessity to install bunch of apps. \nWhat that means for developers? People who are currently working as Mobile Developers will need to learn Web Development. People who are currently working as Web Developers will need to learn Mobile Development. Additionally, future developers will not necessary need to know all different platforms (iOS, Android, WP), because they will be able to create apps in HTML5 and JavaScript (which should be well supported and compatible with Mobile Web Browsers in next 5 years).\nThis is my prediction. We&#39;ll see what happens after 5 years.\n"

    "content"  : "Mac (UNIX) users use to be working with Terminal a lot. There is a few tips, which can make your life easier. First of all, if you are working on Mac - install iTerm2 and use it instead of standard Terminal. It is just more powerful. There is many features not available in standard Terminal. I find very useful the possibilities to search with CMD+F and copy entire path with double click by mouse (when you double click in standard Terminal it copies only one word). Another cool thing is &#39;split terminal&#39; view. You can have multiple panes in one window.\n\nSecond improvement to work faster is creation some aliases for commonly use commands. E.g. ls, clear or la -ls. You might also want to customize command prompt. I don&#39;t like the standard one with Machine and user name (I always know in which Machine I am, and which user I am using - in case of doubts I can use whoami). To do add aliases and change default command prompt you need to modify your ~/.bashrc file. There is my .bashrc:\n[bash]alias dir=&#39;ls -lap&#39;\nalias l=&#39;ls&#39;\nalias p=&#39;pwd&#39;\nalias c=&#39;clear&#39;\nalias o=&#39;open&#39;\nalias tree=&amp;quot;ls -R | grep \\&amp;quot;:$\\&amp;quot; | sed -e &#39;s/:$//&#39; -e &#39;s/[^-][^\\/]*\\//--/g&#39; -e &#39;\\s/^/   /&#39; -e &#39;s/-/|/&#39;&amp;quot;\nexport PS1=&amp;quot;[\\W]$ &amp;quot;[/bash]\nHere you can find a list of various options to customize your command prompt.\nTo load this settings automatically each time you run Terminal, you also need to add below command to ~/.profile file:\nsource ~/.bashrc\nAfter above improvements my terminal looks like that:\n\nHint: when you are playing with your command prompt (or aliases), you can simple run command source ~/.bashrc from terminal to check the result of changes you made.\nAnd of course I use black terminal with green font color.\n\n"

    "content"  : "I am PC person. I have never used Mac until I start my work as Research Assistant in SAnToS lab (Kansas State University). Now I am using it almost half year and I would like to summarize my experience.\nI am using MacBook Pro (i5 2.4GHz, 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD) with Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.\n\nFirst of all, I noticed missing features (which are available on PC/Windows):\n\nClick on app icon in dock (dock is equivalent to taskbar in Windows) does not hide application. It can only move the app to the top. The only way to hide the app is to click minimize button.\nLack of good alternative for Total Commander, which is not available on Mac. There is muCommander (no tabs) and double commander (less functional), but both are way behind TC.\nNo Shift-Delete to permanently remove files. You need to move them to trash first, and then empty the trash.\nNo &#39;cut&#39; in context menu (after right click). To have this luxury you need to install e.g. Total Finder (beyond the &#39;cut&#39; option it also provides the possibility to have tabs and some other useful features). \n\nNow, a few differences between Mac OS and Windows:\n\nThe default file manager is called Finder instead of Explorer.\nIn general, when you would use CTRL+KEY in Windows, then in MacOS you need to use CMD+KEY.\nTo change file name you need to click RETURN(ENTER) instead of F2(in Windows).\nTo open the file you need to click CMD+O, instead of ENTER (in Windows).\nDELETE key is working like PC&#39;s RETURN (delete character on the left side of the cursor).\nInstead of HOME key you have CMD+LEFT_ARROW, and instead of END key - CMD+RIGHT_ARROW.\n\nI use OneNote a lot. One of my favorite features is WIN+S, which allows me to make a screenshot of selected area in desktop. On Mac OS this feature is provided along with the operating system. CMD+SHIFT+4 saves the photo into Desktop, and CMD+OPTION+SHIFT+4 saves it into clipboard. Very useful feature. However I think Apple should consider to create some two-key shortcut like CMD+4 or CMD+F4, because clicking 4 keys in the same time is quite a challenging.\nAnother nice feature is possibility to use country specific letters like ę, ń, ś, ć, ä, ö even when you have english version of the system. You just need to hold the key and then there is small tooltip showing possible special letters. You can choose the letter with mouse or using keyboard (by picking the number).\n\nThe last thing I would like to mention is my favorite: the trackpad (touchpad). It is just awesome! Maybe it is not strict part of operating system, but the gestures are implemented in it. You can see the demo of the gestures here. The MacBook Pro trackpad is also well made. Much better than touchpad in all notebooks I have used before.\nWhen you are working on Mac, you use Terminal a lot (when you are developer). In that case it will be nice to have &#39;Open Terminal here&#39; option in finder, which open the Terminal in directory you have clicked on. That is just my wish to Apple :)\nI think it took me about a month to become comfortable with using Mac.\nEDIT: There is one more nice feature I just find out: you can past text without formatting by clicking CMD+ALT+SHIFT+V. And again...4 keys in the same time. But in this case I can&#39;t push them all with one hand :) Maybe CMD+SHIFT+V would be more user friendly? \n"

    "content"  : "In my current job (Research Assistant at SAnToS lab) I had to learn Python. I was very happy because of that. It gaves me an opportunity to get familiar with one of the most popular programming languages nowadays. \nI was very lucky to find awesome Google&#39;s Python Class by Nick Parlante. It is great! If you want to start programming with Python or just learn it for fun, start with this tutorial!\nAs a supplement to above course you can read some more detailed tutorial. I went through two: Learn Python The Hard Way and Tutorial from Python documentation. However if you already know some other programming language(s), your should learn during development. Python contains almost all common features of programming languages such as if/else, loops, exceptions, functions, classes etc. I said &#39;almost&#39;, because there is e.g. no switch instruction. However to check things like that there is very well written documentation. It contains a lot of examples. The main difference between other popular languages like (C, C# or Java) and Python is that there is no semicolons. We use colons and indentation instead.\n[python]if number &amp;gt; 0:\n  print &amp;quot;This is natural number.&amp;quot;\nelse:\n  print &amp;quot;This is not natural number.&amp;quot;[/python] \nPython is dynamic, strongly typed programming language. It means type checking occurs during the run time, instead of compilation time. Programming in Python is a real pleasure. Sometimes you can explicitly put your mind into the code. That is because of high level of abstraction. E.g. file operations are so simple and intuitive. You do not need to remember any StreamReaders or BufferedReaders and bunch of functions for simple I/O operations. Below example reads content of file.\n[python]f = open(&#39;file.txt&#39;)\nf.read()\nf.close()[/python]\nCool feature is the possibility to call functions explicitly on string. Like that:\n[python]&amp;quot;jakub&amp;quot;.upper()[/python] \nThere is a lot of implemented (widely used) functions in Python. As a comparison, let&#39;s see how to reverse words in a sentence using C, Java and Python.\nIn C:\n[c]void reverse_words(char *sentence)\n{\n   char *start = sentence;\n   char *end = sentence;\n   while (*end != &#39;&amp;#92;&amp;#48;&#39;) {\n      ++end;\n   }\n   --end;\n   reverse_chars(start, end);\n   while (*start != &#39;&amp;#92;&amp;#48;&#39;) {\n      for (; *start != &#39;&amp;#92;&amp;#48;&#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; *start == &#39; &#39;; start++) ;\n      for (end=start; *end != &#39;&amp;#92;&amp;#48;&#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; *end != &#39; &#39;; end++) ;\n      --end;\n      reverse_chars(start, end);\n      start = ++end;\n   }\n}\nvoid reverse_chars(char *left, char *right)\n{\n   char temp;\n   while( left &amp;lt; right) {\n      temp = *left;\n      *left = *right;\n      *right = temp;\n      ++left;\n      --right;\n   }\n}[/c]\nIn Java:\n[java]\npublic string ReverseWords(string sentence)\n{\n  string[] words =  sentence.split(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;);\n  string rev = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;;\n  for(int i = words.length - 1; i &amp;gt;= 0 ; i--)\n  {\n    rev += words[i] + &amp;quot; &amp;quot;;\n  }\n  return rev;\n}[/java]\nIn Python:\n[python]def reverse_words(sentence):\n  return &amp;quot; &amp;quot;.join(reversed(sentence.split(&amp;quot; &amp;quot;)))[/python]\nThat&#39;s why Python is good for Rapid Development.\nI am also using PyGTK (graphic library for Python) in my work. There is a great tutorial Python GTK on youtube! PyGTK requires very less code than e.g. C# to create some simple application. We do not to have tons of generated code when we start. We create application from scratch. Look at below Hello World example.\n[python]import pygtk\npygtk.require(&#39;2.0&#39;)\nimport gtk\nclass HelloWorld:\n    def hello(self, widget, data=None):\n        print &amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot;\n    def destroy(self, widget, data=None):\n        gtk.main_quit()\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.window = gtk.Window(gtk.WINDOW_TOPLEVEL)\n        self.window.connect(&amp;quot;destroy&amp;quot;, self.destroy)\n        self.window.set_border_width(10)\n        self.button = gtk.Button(&amp;quot;Hello World&amp;quot;)\n        self.button.connect(&amp;quot;clicked&amp;quot;, self.hello, None)\n        self.window.add(self.button)\n        self.button.show()\n        self.window.show()\n    def main(self):\n        gtk.main()\nif __name__ == &amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot;:\n    hello = HelloWorld()\n    hello.main()[/python]\nThe result is the window with button &#39;Hello World&#39;. When you click the button, then &#39;Hello World&#39; will be printed on console. All of that with 22 lines of code (I do not count white lines).\n\nIf you don&#39;t know python yet, I encourage you to try it. Programming in python requires a little bit different way of thinking. It also allows you to look at the programming from the different perspective. \nPython installation is easy on all operating systems and you can find it in google. To install PyGTK in Windows you can use all in-one installer. There is also all-in-one installer for Mac. PyGTK is included in most Linux distributions, so you won&#39;t need to install it if you are using Linux.\n"

    "content"  : "Studying in United States is a way different than in Poland. In October 2008 I started Bachelor of Science at Wroclaw University of Technology (Poland). In Fall 2011 I was exchange student at the Kansas State University (USA). After that I camealt back and graduated at WUT (Wroclaw University of Technology) in January 2012. Then I started Master of Science (in English) and I also applied for Master program at the KSU (Kansas State University) and UA (University of Arizona) for Fall 2012. I was admitted to both Universities, but I didn&#39;t get assistantship offer (to be Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant). Everybody knows that studying in USA is pretty expensive, but not when you have assistantship. Then department is paying for your tuition and you have salary/scholarship, which enables you to cover living expenses (such as rent apartment, food etc.). However I got an RA (Research Assistant) offer from KSU in July and finally started Master program in Spring 2013 (because it was too late to make VISA related issues done before Fall 2012). \nIn USA there are Fall and Spring semesters. Fall starts usually in the middle of August and ends in December before Christmas. Then there is winter break till middle January. After that Spring semester starts, and it ends in mid-May.\n\nOne of my friends (who got PhD at KSU) said that the difference between KSU and WUT is that KSU gives you real opportunity to learn something: it is easier to get good grades but it is also easier to learn a lot. I agree in 100%. The standard amount of classes for Undergraduate student (Bachelor degree) is 15 credit hours (30 ECTS), which is about 5 courses (usually one course has 3 credits). At WUT sometimes I had 10 courses. The standard amount for Graduate Student (Master or PhD) is only 9 credits (3 courses). It is not because it is easier, but courses are more time consuming. That is because there is much more to learn than in typical 6 ECTS course in WUT. Usually Master Student is also TA (Teaching Assistant) or RA (Research Assistant), which means additionally 20 or more hours. Last semester I took one class, which consumed about 10 hours (excluding classes) per week for me (you can find estimated work amount here). It is like 2 hours every day, and I had two more classes and research. As a reward I learnt a lot.\nAnother difference is that there is no strict list of courses you need to take. In Poland, all students from the same major has the same classes (only in last two semesters you can choose specialty but you still have the same classes with ~40 people). In USA, student choose courses on his own. There are minimum requirements, but usually you have a choice to pick one of a few proposed courses to satisfy one area requirement. You can find a degree requirements for Master degree in my department here. \n\nSometimes in WUT it is enough to study only one day before exam (if there is no laboratory or tutorials for that course). Here in USA it is impossible. You need to study every week, because of homeworks, quizes, required reading etc. In some courses there are quizzes in every week. Additionally &#39;quiz&#39; not necessarily means ABCD. In my department it is always open-question test. The 90% of International students coming here for exchange from Europe, after two weeks says: &quot;In last two weeks I was that busy like in finals week at my University&quot;. In last semester, the day before semester start I received an email that I have a quiz in my first class and I need to be prepared for it (by reading given materials).\nIn USA everybody cares about studying. Students are not playing games during the lectures. Even when lecture is not obligatory, almost everybody is there and they interact with instructor a lot.\nDisclaimer: All information given above are based on my personal experience. Everything can be different depends on the University, Department and even course you take.\n"

    "content"  : "When you are looking for a good mouse, you always find lists of &#39;top mouses for gamers&#39;. However good mouse is also very important for developers. People who spend most of their time on computer.  Usually we use various of applications and moving between them is like playing Call of Duty. When you want to click maximize button in VirtualBox or VMWare and you hit close instead, you are dead (VM start closing). You need to start your mission over (run the VM again). Some developers have problems with their hands (pain) caused by mouse use. It is good to invest some money in mouse instead of buying the cheapest or random one. However I have never spend on mouse more than $30. I tried various types of cheapest ones and medium-price.\n\n\n\nFive years ago I made one of my best purchase: A4-Tech XL-750BF. I paid about $20. It was very good mouse in the notion of precision and comfort. I like to have high DPI. This mouse has 6 modes: 600-800-1200-1600-2000-2500 DPI (adjustable by a little key on top). I use to work on 2500 DPI. Unfortunately, after 3 years the left key broke down. Not completely though, but when I was dragging items, sometimes they were dropped when key was still pushed (instead of MOUSE_DOWN I had MOUSE_DOWN-MOUSE_UP-MOUSE_DOWN sequence).\nThen I decided to invest in better brand and I bought Razer Salmosa. I found good deal on eBay for ~$25. It was quite good, but too small for my hand, and not that comfortable as A4-Tech was. This mouse was good for less than 2 years. Then (again!) left button broke down. Maybe I am not using it appropriate?\n\n\n\nAfter that I thought my next mouse&#39;s left button will probably be broken too after some time and I decided to buy the cheapest Logitech: M100 ($7 on eBay). It is good mouse, but only if you do not have any other. A few weeks after purchase I found new A4-Tech: X-748K. It had good reviews and I decided to buy it. And again A4-Tech becomes very good choice. I paid $20 and I love this mouse! It has also 6 DPI modes (like X-750BF): 600-800-1200-1600-2400-3200. It fits perfectly to my hand and is nice in touch. The slightly rough surface is very cool. I am using it almost three weeks and it&#39;s working fine. It is the best mouse I have ever use. We&#39;ll see how long it lasts :)\n"

    "content"  : "Have you ever forgotten to lock your computer and went for a lunch? If so then you know what can happen. Your coworkers can send invitation for a party at your place to all co-workers (using your e-mail). They can also mess up with your desktop icons and much, much other fun stuff. The best solution is always lock the system. However sometimes we forget about it.\nOnce I was bored after work I created WinForms application, which starts playing scary sound when somebody move the mouse or push some key on the keyboard (while I am out of my desk). Usually when you want to mess up with somebody&#39;s machine your heart rate is higher than normal (because of adrenaline that you can be caught). Then not expected scary sound can cause even heart attack.\nI named my app: Desktop Watcher. It looks like that:\n\nWhen you hit Play, you get file dialog to choose some scary sound (like this) from your hard drive. Then you need to put cursor in the program area and leave your machine. You have 5 seconds for that. Every mouse move or keyboard&#39;s key push after that will start sound playing and lock the machine. If you caught somebody the machine will be locked and sound will be playing. To quit the app you need to unlock the machine and hit ALT-F4  immediately (two keys together - because hit only ALT will cause lock screen again) or close app by mouse if you are quick hand person.\nNo worries that somebody close your app by ALT-F4 before he moves the mouse. If so then system will be locked anyway (but no sound will be played). You do not need to worry about it, because it means that somebody knew you prepared a trap :)\nThere is an issue that mouse needs to be in the program area to detect mouse moves. I may fix it in the future, but for now you can just hide the app somewhere (e.g. on right bottom corner):\n\nSource (and sample scary sound) is available on github: https://github.com/jj09/DesktopWatcher.\n"
