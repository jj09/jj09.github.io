      <h1><a href="/garmin-programming-competition-2014/">Garmin Programming Competition 2014</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Yesterday at my university, <a href="http://www.garmin.com/">Garmin</a> was hosting the Programming Competition.</p>
<p>Competition like that is a great opportunity to practice programming, algorithms and problem solving skills. </p>
<p>We could form teams of 1-2 students. My partner was <a href="http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~danielwang/">Daniel Wang</a>. We could use following languages: C++, C#, Java and Python. We chose Java. We were using Eclipse IDE and git to share the code.</p>
<p>Organizers prepared very real-life <a href="http://jj09.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GarminProgrammingCompetition2014.pdf">problems</a>. </p>
<p>Competitions had two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read and perform simple input conversion (1 hour).</li>
<li>Reuse code from Program 1 and do more complicated operations with input (3 hours).</li>
</ol>
<p>We solved part 1 without any problems. Part 2 required two programs: 2A and 2B. We solved both, but our programs didn't pass all test cases. In 2A: 3/5 test cases passed, in 2B: 4/5. There were points for correct solution and bonus points (depended on the time when solution was submitted). Additionally, there was a timer showing how many bonus points we could earn sending solution now.</p>
<p>You can find problems description <a href="http://jj09.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GarminProgrammingCompetition2014.pdf">here</a>. Our solutions are available on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jj09/garmin-programming-competition-2014">Bitbucket repository</a>. Be aware that it is bad code, written under time pressure and never refactored. However, efficient enough to pass required time constraints. This is how you write code during programming contests :)</p>
<p>After competition we asked organizers about test input sets and they sent it to us. </p>
<p>This is the description of the bug we had and how we fix it (you can skip this part if you don't want to read the <a href="http://jj09.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/GarminProgrammingCompetition2014.pdf">description of problems</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>The issue we had, was reading (shift mod 26) straight from the input file. Because e.g. shift = 45 should be effectively shift = 19 (45 mod 26). The program should stop when shift = 0. Then, when original shift was e.g. 52 we had stored shift=0 and we stopped (which was wrong). We thought that we should stop when the 'effective shift' is 0. Unfortunately, the test cases were stopping when the 'original shift' was 0. Fix was pretty easy (we just store two values: shift and shiftOrig for each cell). It would be very hard to fix this without test cases from organizers ;) It was like in real-life: small detail caused significant error.</p></blockquote>
<p>The challenge during programming competitions is that you cannot get all test cases. This time, there were 1 sample input per program. Which make sense, because otherwise everybody could just hardcode expected solution :) What is worse, you cannot see the program output (in case of runtime error). Fortunately, guys form Garmin were nice and when we asked, they were showing us the output (on their machine). It helped us (a lot) in fixing the runtime errors (during the competition).</p>
<p>The next event I am looking forward is <a href="https://code.google.com/codejam/"> Google Code Jam</a>. It starts in April 11, 2014 (Friday). Registration begins in March 11. I really encourage you to sign up. You can learn what various problems you can face and what you should consider during writing your programs. Additionally you can practice, apply your programming skills and compete with the best programmers in the World.</p>

      <h1><a href="/compilers-course-i-had/">Compilers course I had</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>In the last semester (Fall 2013) I had a pleasure to take course CIS706 - Translator Design (aka Compilers) with <a href="http://people.cis.ksu.edu/~robby/">Dr Robby</a> at Kansas State University. It was great experience! I think it is the best course I have ever taken.</p>
<p>The way how this course is designed is just amazing. During course about compilers you will also learn many other useful things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Eclipse</li>
<li>Source Control (git)</li>
<li>Unit Testing (JUnit) and TDD</li>
<li>Reading legacy code</li>
<li>Java Byte Code</li>
</ul>
<p>How? You have to build the compiler for simple, Java based language called ExtendedStaticJava. You have 4 homeworks: parsing, building AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), type checking and byte code generation. For each of them you have 'legacy' code, which implements compiler for StaticJava. Your task is to extend it to handle ExtendedStaticJava syntax. For each homework you get around 100 Unit Tests. Your grade depends on number of passing tests. If all test are passing you get 100%. Implementation does not matter...but you might need to pay for workarounds later, because each homework is based on the code from previous one. I experienced this. I made a few hacks in first homework and then I needed to fix them during homework 2. It cost me extra time and I had to send incomplete solution. It is exactly how it goes in "Real World"! </p>
<p>For final project (last month of semester) we needed to create ExtendedStaticJava to C transpiler with Garbage Collector. Transpiler is source-to-source compiler. In other words: resulting code was C with Garbage Collector calls (GC was also implemented by us in C). We reused our homeworks (without byte code generation part) and generated C code (with GC calls) using <a href="http://www.stringtemplate.org/">StringTemplate</a>.</p>
<p>Let's take a look how all above help us to be better developers. </p>
<p>Most of students probably already know Java. If not - this course is the best time to learn. Java and C# are the most popular, static typing programming languages (today). When you learn one of them - it is easy to catch up with another. Java is still the most popular language in case of job offers (<a href="http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2013/02/traditional-programming-language-job-trends-2013-02.html">source</a>):</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2014/02/traditionalLanguageJobTrends-Indeed.png" alt="traditional Language Job Trends - Indeed" width="540" height="300" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-877" /></p>
<p>Thus, probability that you will be programming in Java after you graduate is pretty high. When you will be programming in Java, you will be probably using <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130220082953AACCzwM">Eclipse - its most popular IDE</a>. Another 'standard' in industry is Source Control. If the company you are working for is not using it - you should change your company(!), because something wrong is going on there. If you are not familiar with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> (leader in Open Source community, now being adapted by the industry) then this course is the best time to learn. Nowadays, even big companies (e.g. Microsoft) open sourcing their code (e.g. <a href="https://aspnet.codeplex.com/">ASP.NET</a> or <a href="https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR">SignalR</a>), which is available through git.</p>
<p>Unit testing is very popular nowadays. Lots of commercial projects use this technique to ensure software quality and development stability. Many projects are also using TDD (Test Driven Development) approach. First your write the test (as the requirement) and then code. When test pass, you refactor the code. During the course we were using JUnit (for now: No.1 Unit Test Framework for Java). Additionally, when you learn how to work with Unit Tests, then picking up a different framework is very easy (even in different language).</p>
<p>Software Development is a team work. Because of that, you will need to read code of other developers everyday. In most of courses during your University career you need to create some applications from scratch. Sometimes you are working in team of 2 or 3 people. Then in your first job, you get 100 000 lines of code written by somebody else. Often without documentation and sometimes people who wrote this code are not working there anymore. In other words - you're screwed. Compilers class will prepare you for that. During the course you will need to understand the existing code (StaticJava compiler), extend it and introduce some changes to get ExtendedStaticJava compiler working and Unit Tests passing.</p>
<p>Besides learning Java, you will also learn how JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and ByteCode are working. The idea of intermediate code is also used in C#: code is compiled to an Intermediate Language (IL) which then runs in the Common Language Runtime (CLR). It is very helpful for understanding how high-level code is translated to Assembly language.</p>
<p>It is also worth to mention about the essence of the course: compilers. The course is based on the popular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-Edition/dp/0321486811">Dragon Book</a>. You will learn about every stage of compiling: lexical analysis, parsing, creating AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), semantic analysis, optimization and code generation. For parsing and AST creation you will use <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a>, which is the most popular tool for such purpose nowadays. Finally you will get understanding, what is going on between your high-level code and electrical impulses flowing in your computer.</p>
<p>Even if you know all of these things (Java, Eclipse, git, Unit testing) it is still worth to take this class. You will apply your knowledge in practice and learn about compilers. This knowledge is useful not only to understand how computers work, but also to learn about algorithms and data structures, which are applied there.</p>
<p>You can find more information about CIS706 on <a href="http://compilers.santoslab.org/">compilers website</a>. Moreover the StaticJava code is available on github: <a href="https://github.com/santoslab/compiler">github.com/santoslab/compiler</a>. There is also nice <a href="https://class.coursera.org/compilers-003">Compilers Course by Stanford University on Coursera</a>, which can be used as supplement for this class.</p>

      <h1><a href="/i-am-back/">I am back!</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Last two months were super busy for me. The end of semester (with <a href="http://compilers.santoslab.org/">compilers course</a>'s project), applying for a PhD studies, Christmas, New Year's eve in Poland, and a job interview. I will tell you more about all of those things later in separated posts. Maybe not all, Christmas and New Year's eve experience I will keep for myself :)</p>
<p>I am happy that all above is accomplished and I can get back to my routine (programming, blogging, reading books and learning new things).</p>
<p>It is worth to summarize the last year, which was quite successful:</p>
<ol>
<li>I started Master of Science in Computer Science program at the Kansas State University.</li>
<li>I started this blog.</li>
<li>I created twitter account and started using it.</li>
<li>I co-organized <a href="http://www.dotnetconf.pl">dotNetConfPL</a> (with <a href="http://mfranc.com/">Michal Franc</a> and <a href="http://pawel.sawicz.eu/">Pawel Sawicz</a>).</li>
<li>I almost maintained 4.0 GPA (I have 3.8 for now).</li>
<li>I applied for Microsoft Student Partner position, but Microsoft rejected me.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main goals for this year are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Graduate with Master of Science degree from Kansas State University.</li>
<li>Start a new job.</li>
<li>Run <a href="http://www.dotnetconf.pl">dotNetConfPL 2014</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I also would like to finally attend <a href="http://devday.pl">Dev Day</a> conference in KrakÃ³w, but I am not sure if I will be in Poland on September 26.</p>
<p>During 'the break' I came up with a lot of ideas. I have 6 drafts for blog posts, 5 topics for a blog posts on the to do list and tons of 'new, cool things' to check out. When you get busy, because of School, work, personal issues etc. - don't worry. Take a break, get all of more important things done and once you get back, you will be more happy and motivated than before.</p>

      <h1><a href="/update-to-windows-8-1-from-windows-8/">Update to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Before you decide to upgrade your Windows 8 to 8.1, you should be aware of some issues/changes.</p>
<p>To begin with, it is not very obvious and easy to find a way, to avoid using Microsoft Account. Fortunately, Scott Hanselman described it in his blog, in his post <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HowToSignIntoWindows8Or81WithoutAMicrosoftAccountMakeALocalUser.aspx">How to sign into Windows 8 or 8.1 without a Microsoft account - make a local user</a>.</p>
<p>Another issue is SkyDrive. If you are not using it, then you do not need to worry. But if you do (like me) then be aware that now it is integrated with Windows 8.1. You are not able to use SkyDrive app like in Windows 8. What is more: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you need to sign in with Microsoft Account on Windows 8.1, to be able to use SkyDrive</span>. In the recent version of SkyDrive, Microsoft introduced "smart files". It distinguish two types of files: online-only (not stored on your hard drive and available when you are connected to the Internet) and offline (old-style files, can be used when you are offline and will be synced once you get online). Default status of new created file is online-only. You need to change it if you want to use files in the old-way (offline). There are two ways to do that. First: go to SkyDrive app and mark file/directory you want to make offline (by right click) and click "Make offline" in app bar:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-820" src="/assets/2014/01/SkyDrive-makeOffline.jpg" alt="SkyDrive - make offline" width="800" /></p>
<p>Second way is go to SkyDrive settings and set "Access all files offline" to "On":</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-823" src="/assets/2014/01/SkyDrive-accessAllFilesOffline.jpg" alt="SkyDrive - access all files offline" width="346" height="267" /></p>
<p>You can find more details about "smart files" <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/skydrive-online-available-offline">here</a>.</p>
<p>All above issues are fixable. However there are a few things, which cannot be solved (so far). I have ThinkPad X220 (i5@2.3GHz, 8GB RAM, 160GB SSD) and I did a system upgrade from Win8 to Win8.1. Since then, the performance is a little bit worse. Additionally, I have two monitors connected through VGA and DisplayPort. The second monitor is all gray right after system boot. I need to click WIN+D to get the desktop. I do not have this issue on my PC where I installed Win 8.1 from scratch.</p>
<p>I use PowerShell as my default command line. There is a weird issue with Lucidia Console font on Windows 8.1. You cannot set it as default font. It is not a huge concern, because the Consolas works fine, but I cannot use Lucidia Console (which I like better). More about this issue <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/538607/cannot-change-powershell-default-font-to-lucida-console">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the bright side of life. My favorite Windows 8.1 feature is "search everywhere". You do not need to think whether you want to search programs (WIN+Q), settings (WIN+W) or files (WIN+F). However, <a href="http://www.voidtools.com/">Everything Search Engine</a> is still the best for searching files.</p>
<p>I like the Windows button too. After right-click, you have the same menu which you get with WIN+X. Furthermore, there are options shutdown/restart/sleep there. It is easier and faster accessible than "Mouse to right-bottom corner of screen"-&gt;Settings-&gt;Power-&gt;Shut down.</p>
<p>Another nice feature is the adjustable size of tiles:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-834" src="/assets/2014/01/Windows81-adjustableTiles.jpg" alt="Windows8.1 - adjustable tiles" width="513" height="260" /></p>
<p>To learn about other new features I recommend Scott Hanselman's <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ThreeAllNewWindows81VideoTutorialsWhatsNewIn81KeyboardShortcutsAndManagingWindows.aspx">videos about new features in Windows 8.1</a>. He is showing how to be productive on Windows 8.1 and how to take advantage of key shortcuts.</p>
<p><strong>By the way: <span style="font-size: 27px;">Happy New Year 2014!</span></strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-830" src="/assets/2014/01/new-year-eve-fireworks-2014-new-york.jpg" alt="Happy New Year 2014" width="800" height="470" /></p>
