      <h1><a href="/studying-in-the-usa/">Studying in the USA</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Studying in United States is a way different than in Poland. In October 2008 I started Bachelor of Science at Wroclaw University of Technology (Poland). In Fall 2011 I was exchange student at the <a href="http://www.ksu.edu">Kansas State University</a> (USA). After that I camealt back and graduated at WUT (Wroclaw University of Technology) in January 2012. Then I started Master of Science (in English) and I also applied for Master program at the KSU (Kansas State University) and UA (University of Arizona) for Fall 2012. I was admitted to both Universities, but I didn't get assistantship offer (to be Teaching Assistant or Research Assistant). Everybody knows that studying in USA is pretty expensive, but not when you have assistantship. Then department is paying for your tuition and you have salary/scholarship, which enables you to cover living expenses (such as rent apartment, food etc.). However I got an RA (Research Assistant) offer from KSU in July and finally started Master program in Spring 2013 (because it was too late to make VISA related issues done before Fall 2012). </p>
<p>In USA there are Fall and Spring semesters. Fall starts usually in the middle of August and ends in December before Christmas. Then there is winter break till middle January. After that Spring semester starts, and it ends in mid-May.</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/2013/06/ksu_campus.jpg" alt="Kansas State Campus" width="100%" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-159" /></div>
<p>One of my friends (who got PhD at KSU) said that the difference between KSU and WUT is that KSU gives you real opportunity to learn something: it is easier to get good grades but it is also easier to learn a lot. I agree in 100%. The standard amount of classes for Undergraduate student (Bachelor degree) is 15 credit hours (30 ECTS), which is about 5 courses (usually one course has 3 credits). At WUT sometimes I had 10 courses. The standard amount for Graduate Student (Master or PhD) is only 9 credits (3 courses). It is not because it is easier, but courses are more time consuming. That is because there is much more to learn than in typical 6 ECTS course in WUT. Usually Master Student is also TA (Teaching Assistant) or RA (Research Assistant), which means additionally 20 or more hours. Last semester I took one class, which consumed about 10 hours (excluding classes) per week for me (you can find estimated work amount <a href="http://santos.cis.ksu.edu/771/node/4">here</a>). It is like 2 hours every day, and I had two more classes and research. As a reward I learnt a lot.</p>
<p>Another difference is that there is no strict list of courses you need to take. In Poland, all students from the same major has the same classes (only in last two semesters you can choose specialty but you still have the same classes with ~40 people). In USA, student choose courses on his own. There are minimum requirements, but usually you have a choice to pick one of a few proposed courses to satisfy one area requirement. You can find a degree requirements for Master degree in my department <a href="http://www.cis.ksu.edu/sites/default/files/MS%20Checklist%20FORM%20_4.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p><img src="/assets/2013/06/ksu_campus2.jpg" alt="Kansas State Campus" width="100%" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-167" /></p>
<p>Sometimes in WUT it is enough to study only one day before exam (if there is no laboratory or tutorials for that course). Here in USA it is impossible. You need to study every week, because of homeworks, quizes, required reading etc. In some courses there are quizzes in every week. Additionally 'quiz' not necessarily means ABCD. In my department it is always open-question test. The 90% of International students coming here for exchange from Europe, after two weeks says: "In last two weeks I was that busy like in finals week at my University". In last semester, the day before semester start I received an email that I have a quiz in my first class and I need to be prepared for it (by reading given materials).</p>
<p>In USA everybody cares about studying. Students are not playing games during the lectures. Even when lecture is not obligatory, almost everybody is there and they interact with instructor a lot.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: All information given above are based on my personal experience. Everything can be different depends on the University, Department and even course you take.</p>

      <h1><a href="/developer-mouse/">Developer mouse</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>When you are looking for a good mouse, you always find lists of 'top mouses for gamers'. However good mouse is also very important for developers. People who spend most of their time on computer.  Usually we use various of applications and moving between them is like playing Call of Duty. When you want to click maximize button in VirtualBox or VMWare and you hit close instead, you are dead (VM start closing). You need to start your mission over (run the VM again). Some developers have problems with their hands (pain) caused by mouse use. It is good to invest some money in mouse instead of buying the cheapest or random one. However I have never spend on mouse more than $30. I tried various types of cheapest ones and medium-price.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/assets/2013/06/A4TechSnakeX-750BF-300x300.jpg" alt="A4Tech SnakeX-750BF" width="300" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-104" /><img src="/assets/2013/06/RazerSamlosa-300x241.jpg" alt="Razer Samlosa" width="300" height="241" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-106" style="display: inline" /><img src="/assets/2013/06/LogitechM100-273x300.png" alt="Logitech M100" width="273" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-105" style="display: inline" />
</div>
<p>Five years ago I made one of my best purchase: <a href="http://www.x7.cn/en/product.asp?id=12">A4-Tech XL-750BF</a>. I paid about $20. It was very good mouse in the notion of precision and comfort. I like to have high DPI. This mouse has 6 modes: 600-800-1200-1600-2000-2500 DPI (adjustable by a little key on top). I use to work on 2500 DPI. Unfortunately, after 3 years the left key broke down. Not completely though, but when I was dragging items, sometimes they were dropped when key was still pushed (instead of MOUSE_DOWN I had MOUSE_DOWN-MOUSE_UP-MOUSE_DOWN sequence).</p>
<p>Then I decided to invest in better brand and I bought <a href="http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/Razer/Salmosa/">Razer Salmosa</a>. I found good deal on eBay for ~$25. It was quite good, but too small for my hand, and not that comfortable as A4-Tech was. This mouse was good for less than 2 years. Then (again!) left button broke down. Maybe I am not using it appropriate?</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/assets/2013/06/A4TechOscarX-748K-300x200.jpg" alt="A4Tech OscarX-748K" width="300" height="200" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-103" />
</div>
<p>After that I thought my next mouse's left button will probably be broken too after some time and I decided to buy the cheapest Logitech: <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mouse-m100?crid=7">M100</a> ($7 on eBay). It is good mouse, but only if you do not have any other. A few weeks after purchase I found new A4-Tech: <a href="http://www.x7.cn/en/product.asp?id=40">X-748K</a>. It had <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B001B2RTBY">good reviews</a> and I decided to buy it. And again A4-Tech becomes very good choice. I paid $20 and I love this mouse! It has also 6 DPI modes (like X-750BF): 600-800-1200-1600-2400-3200. It fits perfectly to my hand and is nice in touch. The slightly rough surface is very cool. I am using it almost three weeks and it's working fine. It is the best mouse I have ever use. We'll see how long it lasts :)</p>

      <h1><a href="/desktop-watcher/">Desktop Watcher</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Have you ever forgotten to lock your computer and went for a lunch? If so then you know what can happen. Your coworkers can send invitation for a party at your place to all co-workers (using your e-mail). They can also mess up with your desktop icons and much, much other fun stuff. The best solution is always lock the system. However sometimes we forget about it.</p>
<p>Once I was bored after work I created WinForms application, which starts playing scary sound when somebody move the mouse or push some key on the keyboard (while I am out of my desk). Usually when you want to mess up with somebody's machine your heart rate is higher than normal (because of adrenaline that you can be caught). Then not expected scary sound can cause even heart attack.</p>
<p>I named my app: Desktop Watcher. It looks like that:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-65" alt="Desktop Watcher" src="/assets/2013/06/DesktopWatcher.jpg" width="139" height="82" /></p>
<p>When you hit <em>Play</em>, you get file dialog to choose some scary sound (<a href="https://github.com/jj09/DesktopWatcher/blob/master/alarm.mp3">like this</a>) from your hard drive. Then you need to put cursor in the program area and leave your machine. You have 5 seconds for that. Every mouse move or keyboard's key push after that will start sound playing and lock the machine. If you caught somebody the machine will be locked and sound will be playing. To quit the app you need to unlock the machine and hit ALT-F4  immediately (two keys together - because hit only ALT will cause lock screen again) or close app by mouse if you are quick hand person.</p>
<p>No worries that somebody close your app by ALT-F4 before he moves the mouse. If so then system will be locked anyway (but no sound will be played). You do not need to worry about it, because it means that somebody knew you prepared a trap :)</p>
<p>There is an issue that mouse needs to be in the program area to detect mouse moves. I may fix it in the future, but for now you can just hide the app somewhere (e.g. on right bottom corner):</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-66" alt="Desktop Watcher hidden" src="/assets/2013/06/DesktopWatcher_hidden-300x140.jpg" width="300" height="140" /></p>
<p>Source (and sample scary sound) is available on github: <a href="https://github.com/jj09/DesktopWatcher">https://github.com/jj09/DesktopWatcher</a>.</p>
