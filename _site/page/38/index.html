      <h1><a href="/getting-started-with-ruby-on-rails/">Getting started with Ruby on Rails</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p><img src="/assets/2013/07/150px-Ruby_on_Rails.svg_.png" alt="Ruby on Rails logo" width="150" height="194" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89" style="float: right" /></p>
<p>Recently I decided to learn Ruby on Rails. When you start learning a new technology you are always looking for the best available materials (to learn as efficient as possible). I did the same (using <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>). Fortunately I found <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/the-best-way-to-learn-ruby-on-rails/">The Best Way to Learn Ruby on Rails</a> and I followed the recommended steps. With small modifications (extensions). </p>
<p>First of all I extended first step. Instead of just going through <a href="http://tryruby.org/">"Try Ruby"</a> exercises I also read first chapter of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a> (which is about Ruby). It was very good move, because this book is written in the way to show the flavors of language by comparison with others. I am a .NET guy, who was coding in PHP, C++, Java and Python before. Because of that I was more interested in the differences between Ruby and these languages, than in programming from ground up. I also reviewed (not read) <a href="http://www.humblelittlerubybook.com/">Humble Little Ruby Book</a>. It is a little bit more deep, but it gives you solid Ruby basics.</p>
<p>I was working with Rails on Windows and on Mac. Installing on Windows is very easy when you use <a href="http://railsinstaller.org/">RubyInstaller</a>. There is also version for Mac. However on Mac you can also install Rails using <a href="http://rvm.io/">RVM</a>. In that case I recommend you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiAz0DnnY_k">installation screncast</a> by Michael Hartl.  On Windows I used <a href="http://railsinstaller.org/">RubyInstaller</a>, but on Mac I took advantage of Michael Hartl's screencast. Additionally you may also need <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlitebrowser/">SQLite Database Browser</a> to browse your database easily. I did not know about it at the beginning and I was using <em>rails dbconsole</em>. Browsing with SQLite Database Browser is much more comfortable!</p>
<p>When I had Rails installed I went through <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/the-intro-to-rails-screencast-i-wish-i-had/">Jeffrey’s Introduction to Rails</a>. During that I tried to follow him, by writing code on my machine, but many times he was too fast. I needed to pausing video very often and even scrolling back to see written command (he was changing screens to quickly). Anyway it was very nice introduction and I recommend it. But you can skip rewriting and trying code he is writing. Just watch it to get a flavor of Rails.</p>
<p>After that I went through <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a> tutorials. I was very lucky, because Code School had promotion in May 18-19, and they provided <a href="railsforzombiestwo.codeschool.com">Rails for Zombies 2</a> for free in these days. These tutorials are very solid. The exercises force you to learn by typing, because you cannot proceed to next level, until you do not finish all tasks.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2013/07/AgileWebDevelopmentWithRails-243x300.jpg" alt="Agile Web Development with Rails cover" width="243" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-92" style="float: right; margin: 10px" /></p>
<p>With all basics gained as described above I started a book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356549">Agile Web Development with Rails</a>. I really like this book. It has 3 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting started (Rails installation, create first app, quick Rails architecture overview)</li>
<li>Building application (tutorial)</li>
<li>Rails in Depth</li>
</ul>
<p>The longest part of the book is the tutorial(2nd). Through this part you are creating an complete application exploring different Rails features. Unfortunately this book is a little bit outdated. Authors use ruby version 1.8.7 and Rails 3.0.0. I installed most recent versions: ruby 1.9.3p392 and Rails 3.2.13. Sometimes you need to fix the code (e.g. Chapter 11 - Task F: Add a Dash of Ajax). During that I found <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails documentation</a> very useful. </p>
<p>The last part is going deep into Rails. I really recommend this part! It is not only about Rails, but also about Web Applications and MVC architecture in general: how browser works, how requests are handled by Rails app, session, cookies etc.</p>
<p>When I was in the middle of book I was a little bit angry (because it is outdated) and I switched to <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails tutorial</a> by Michael Hartl, which is strongly recommended on StackOverflow. Well...guys at SO are right. This is really good piece of knowledge not only about Rails, but also about using git, css, Bootstrap and Web Development in general. I really enjoyed it! If you do not want to buy videos, you can just read the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">free book</a> (it is the same content as in videos and more). There are also nice videos describing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ-b9oZpCZY">advanced setup</a> for Rails development on Mac and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05x1Jk4rT1A">SublimeText configuration for Rails</a>. Actually this tutorial covers Rails development from A to Z. </p>
<p>As a summary to the book and Michael Hartl's tutorial I reviewed <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Guides</a>. It is a nice overview for most important rails features. Can be also used as a reference. Some of the <a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts</a> are also useful.</p>
<p>I wanted to try a few different tutorials/books to see different approaches. E.g. Michael Hartl use rspec for unit tests, but the authors of Agile Web Development with Rails are using rails testing framework.</p>
<p>My adventure with Ruby (on Rails) lasts almost two months. Now I can admit that ROR is a very powerful and developer friendly framework. It contains many features, which are already grabbed by ASP.NET (e.g. migrations, bundling). What was surprising for me, you do not need IDE to develop Rails apps. I use <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">SublimeText2</a> (awesome editor!) and it is really enough. Some Rails developers use VIM or Emacs. Of course there are some IDEs such as <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">RubyMine</a> or <a href="http://www.aptana.com/products/radrails">Aptana Studio</a>. I tried both. RubyMine seems to be pretty cool...but I stick with SublimeText. Additionally, during Rails development you spend lot of time with console (to create/run/undo migrations, create models/controllers, run tests etc.). </p>
<p>If you want to start Rails development, my recommended steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read first chapter of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a> (it's about Ruby)</li>
<li>Watch <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/the-intro-to-rails-screencast-i-wish-i-had/">Jeffrey’s Introduction to Rails</a> (just watch it, without trying to follow him on your machine!)</li>
<li>Go through <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a> tutorial</li>
<li>Install Rails: on Windows (<a href="http://railsinstaller.org/">RubyInstaller</a>) or on Mac (<a href="http://youtu.be/MiAz0DnnY_k">Michael's Hartl installation guide</a>)</li>
<li>Do <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails tutorial</a> by Michael Hartl</li>
<li>Read 3rd chapter of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356549">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> (you can also read 1st and 2nd chapters, but its content is more or less covered by Michael Hartl's tutorial)</li>
<li>Create blog or some "your idea Rails app"</li>
</ul>
<p>You might also find these tools/resources useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlitebrowser/">SQLite Browser</a></li>
<li><a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Guides</a></li>
<li><a href="http://railscasts.com/">RailsCasts</a></li>
</ul>
<p>What I like in Ruby on Rails? The syntax, convention over configuration and lots of implemented features in the framework layer. Moreover: Rails are just cool.</p>

      <h1><a href="/build-2013/">Build 2013</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>June was a month of conferences for .NET developers! We had <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013">Tech Ed North America</a>, <a href="http://www.ndcoslo.com/">Norwegian Developers Conference</a>, <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/Europe/2013">Tech Ed Europe</a> and bunch more, but the biggest one was <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">Microsoft Build Developer Conference</a>.</p>
<p>All videos are live and available for free on <a href="channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013">Channel 9</a>. Both Keynotes are worth to see, but for .NET people second day's keynote would be more interesting. I also recommend <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a>'s session <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/2-546">What’s New in ASP.NET and Visual Studio 2013</a>. Scott shows lots of nice new features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>One ASP.NET</li>
<li>Bootstrap as default template in ASP.NET project</li>
<li>Multiple default browsers in Visual Studio</li>
<li>Real-Time website refreshing between Visual Studio and Browser (without page reloading)</li>
<li>New ninja snippets</li>
<li>and much, much more</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also very solid session <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/2-509">Introduction to Node.js on Windows Azure</a> by <a href="http://tomasz.janczuk.org/">Tomasz Janczuk</a>. I really enjoyed this session. Tomasz shows Node.js basics, and how to it on Windows Azure in very simple and clear way.</p>
<p>Third must see (if you are .NET dev) is <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-503">Visual Studio 2013 for Web Developers: Deep Dive</a> by Mads Kristensen. Mads shows hot new features in VS editors (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and WebEssentials add-on.</p>
<p>Other interesting stuff: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-9027">3D Printing with Windows</a> - I was in shock when I saw what we can print using 3D Printer</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-504">ASP.NET Web API 2 – Web Services for Websites, Modern Apps, and Mobile Apps</a> - overview of new WebAPI v2: routing, OWIN, testing, OData, security</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-314">TypeScript: Application-Scale JavaScript</a> (Anders Hejlsberg) - overview of TypeScript (Anders Hejlsberg is very good speaker)</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/2-201">Windows Phone: Introducing App Development</a> - nice overview of Windows Phone platform (perfect for people who want to start WP development today) </li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-339">What’s New in the Visual Studio 2013 IDE</a> - some other (than in Mads Kristensen's talk) VS improvements</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-502">Scaling the Real-time Web with ASP.NET SignalR</a> (Damian Edwards) - this is advanced talk, going deep into SignalR scaling (intro to SignalR can be found in <a href="http://www.campusmvp.net/signalr-ebook">this ebook</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/2-306">The Future of C++</a> - overview of future features of C++ 14 (e.g. idea of async/await in C++)</li>

        <p>I published a <a href="http://jj09.net/tools/">list of tools</a> I use everyday. Maybe someone will find something what is useful for him, but never heard about.</p>
<p>I will try to keep it up to date and it will be always accessible through <a href="http://jj09.net/tools">http://jj09.net/tools</a>.</p>
<p>Not all tools are multi-platform. For now, the list is only for Windows. Maybe sometime in the future I will publish also "Mac Specific" tools.</p>

      <h1><a href="/copy-and-paste-without-formatting/">Copy and paste without formatting</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>When you copy some piece of text e.g. from Web Browser to Word it preserves formatting. Which is sometimes (most of the time) unnecessary. I dealt with it (so far) with paste the text into notepad or url input in the browser and then copy again, and finally paste into destination. In case of Web Browser it was: CTRL+C (from source) -&gt; CTRL+T (open new tab) -&gt; CTRL+V (paste formatted text) -&gt; CTRL+A (select entire text) -&gt; CTRL+C (copy again, now it is not formatted) -&gt; CTRL+W (close the tab) -&gt; CTRL+V (paste not formatted text into destination).</p>
<p>I didn’t do that very often, so it wasn’t big issue for me. However recently I was working on some documentation and I was copying/pasting code from IDE into Word a lot. After n-th time I googled for 'copy and paste without formatting' and I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/122404/how-to-copy-and-paste-code-without-rich-text-formatting">nice discussion on StackOverflow</a>. One of recommended tools is <a href="http://www.stevemiller.net/puretext/">PureText</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2013/07/pure_text.jpg" alt="PureText" width="457" height="288" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-343" /></p>
<p>It allows to paste text from clipboard without formatting, by WIN+V. This shortcut can be changed in options.</p>
<p>My life is much easier right now. I am able to save around 5-10 seconds per each CTRL+C/WIN+V.</p>

      <h1><a href="/windows-8-1-preview-and-visual-studio-2013-preview/">Windows 8.1 Preview and Visual Studio 2013 Preview</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>At the <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">build conference</a> (June 26-28, 2013) Microsoft announced <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/preview-download">Windows 8.1 Preview</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/2013-downloads">Visual Studio 2013 Preview</a>. I installed them on my Virtual Machine. Just in case, to protect my system from some unexpected features :)</p>
<p>In case of Windows 8.1 there are no big changes. Only some small, useful improvements. I like 'search all', which enables you to search within apps, settings and files in the same time. However I am still using <a href="http://www.voidtools.com/">Search Everything</a>, because it's faster and more effective. It's also cool to have the Start button, which brings you to the metro desktop, but again - no big deal (I was ok with WIN button). You can find list of improvements/changes <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/159803-windows-8-1-a-complete-list-of-changes-and-new-features">here</a> and <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/10NewFeaturesInWindows81PreviewThatSavedMySurfaceRT.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>The new Visual Studio is more interesting. The One ASP.NET idea is applied. When you create new project, there are only one template: 'ASP.NET Web Application'. Then in second step, you can choose which type<b>s</b> of application<b>s</b> you want to include into it.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-286" style="display: inline;" src="/assets/2013/07/vs2013_oneaspnet.jpg" alt="Visual Studio 2013 One ASP.NET" width="500" /><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-287" style="display: inline;" src="/assets/2013/07/vs2013_oneaspnet_templates.jpg" alt="Visual Studio 2013 One ASP.NET templates" width="400" />&lt;/p&gt;
</div>
<p>There is MVC 5 (Preview) in it, along with various scaffolding options. You can e.g. scaffold just edit action.</p>
<p>Great feature for web developers: you can open page in multiple web browsers and then refresh them all from Visual Studio (e.g. after change in code).</p>
<p>The editors experience is improved. You can have code map in the scroll bar. HTML editor is rewritten from scratch. Short list of my favorite features:</p>
<ul>
<li>new code snippets (in HTML document try: 'div.myClass*4&gt;lorem' and click TAB)</li>
<li>intellisense in web.config</li>
<li>ALT + UP/DOWN - move code line up or down</li>
<li>ALT + 1/2 - extends text selection to level up or down</li>
<li>ALT+SHIFT+W - allows to surround selected text with new tag</li>
<li>ALT+V - voice commands (which shows shortcuts), yes we can speak to Visual Studio!</li>
<li>JavaScript frameworks intellisense (e.g. AngularJS)</li>
</ul>
<p>But the greatest news is: WebEssentials2013 are now Open Source on <a href="https://github.com/madskristensen/WebEssentials2013">github</a>. Everyone can contribute. The policy is to add experimental features to WebEssentials and then move the hottest to Visual Studio (once they are tested). To see all, new, hot features watch <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2013/3-503">Mads Kristensen's talk at build 2013</a>.</p>
<p>Another cool thing is possibility to 'sign in' in the Visual Studio. Once you sign in using your Microsoft account, you can synchronize settings across your devices. Now, it is enough to customize you Visual Studio only once.</p>
<p>There is much more new features. You can find them <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2013/06/26/visual-studio-2013-preview.aspx">here</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2013/06/03/visual-studio-2013.aspx">here</a>.</p>
