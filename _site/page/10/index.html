      <h1><a href="/continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-for-xamarin-ios-with-vsts/">Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery for Xamarin.iOS with VSTS (Vistul Studio Team Services)</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Visual Studio Team Services has great Continuous Integration and Continues Delivery support for Xamarin.</p>
<p>Recently I was configuring pipeline that would build the project, run unit tests (with xUnit), run UI tests (with Xamarin Test Cloud), and, if all tests pass, deploy new version of the app to Hockey App. During the process of creating VSTS build definition I encountered a few problems that I think are worth to share with you.</p>
<p>To make a basic build definition with building Xamarin.iOS project and deploying to Hockey App with VSTS+Xamarin check James Montemagno's <a href="https://blog.xamarin.com/continuous-integration-for-ios-apps-with-visual-studio-team-services/">Continuous Integration for iOS Apps with Visual Studio Team Services</a> first.</p>
<p>The issues I had, that were not described anywhere online:</p>
<ul>
<li>I couldn't use "Visual Studio Test" task for running xUnit tests, because every build definition on VSTS can be executed by only one build agent, and to build Xamarin project I needed Mac build agent.</li>
<li>How to run UI tests (with Xamarin Test Cloud) using the same build that would be later on deployed to Hockey App? Test Cloud requires init code that later on shouldn't be present in deployed app.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Running xUnit tests with Mac build agent</h3>
<p>This requires adding 2 tasks to build definition:</p>
<ol>
<li>Command Line task - to run tests with mono and xUnit console runner.</li>
<li>Publish Test Results task - to display results in build summary</li>
</ol>
<p>First, install xUnit console runner NuGet package.</p>
<p>To run tests, add command line task with following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tool: <em>mono</em></li>
<li>Arguments: <em>packages/xunit.runner.console.<strong>2.1.0</strong>/tools/xunit.console.exe <strong>YourApp</strong>.UnitTests/bin/Debug/<strong>YourApp</strong>.UnitTests.dll -xml UnitTestsResults.xml</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to replace <em>YourApp</em> with your app name, and set the same xUnit runner version that you have installed.</p>
<p>To publish test results, add "Publish Test Results" task with the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test Result Format: <em>XUnit</em></li>
<li>Test Result Files: <em>**/UnitTestsResults.xml</em></li>
<li>Always run: <em>true</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Running Xamarin UI tests with Test Cloud before deploying to HockeyApp</h3>
<p>The solution there is rather simple: build in Debug mode that has <em>TEST_CLOUD</em> preprocessor directive defined, run tests, and then build again in Release mode before deploying to Hockey App.</p>
<h3>Delete files before build</h3>
<p>For a while I couldn't figure out why my tests are not passing when run from VSTS while they pass on my machine. It turned out, VSTS was using old builds for tests. I am not sure about <a href="https://www.macincloud.com/">MacInCloud</a>, but if you are using your own Build Agent running on your Mac the directories that contains binary files are not being cleaned up before next build automatically. To avoid using old builds, you can add, at the beginning of your pipeline, "Delete Files" task and delete everything from bin/* and obj/*.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The final build definition looks like that:</p>

<p>Let me know if I missed some details! I would be happy to add them! Also - if you know better way of doing that - let me know as well!</p>

      <h1><a href="/qcon-shanghai/">QCon Shanghai</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16131" src="/assets/2016/11/QCon.jpeg" alt="QCon" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Last month I had a pleasure to visit China and attend <a href="http://2016.qconshanghai.com">QCon conference in Shanghai</a>.</p>
<p>I gave a talk about building large scale web apps with TypeScript where I updated my talk from last year to TypeScript 2.0, I showed <a href="https://github.com/remojansen/ts-vscode-boilerplate">TypeScript boilerplate project</a> created by <a href="http://www.remojansen.com">Remo Jansen</a>, and using TypeScript with <a href="http://aurelia.io">Aurelia Framework</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16151" src="/assets/2016/11/QCon3.jpeg" alt="QCon" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>//video-coming-soon</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16161" src="/assets/2016/11/QCon4.jpeg" alt="QCon" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>I had a great turnout. Room overflow with over 150 people. I also got a great feedback. People could vote green(awesome), yellow(ok), red(bad), and I received 128 green, only 10 yellow and 1 red, which gives over 92% extremely satisfied attendees.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16141" src="/assets/2016/11/QCon2.jpeg" alt="QCon" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.qconferences.com/">QCon</a> has the best of the best from the industry. In Shanghai I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Levy">Jaime Levy</a> (famous UX strategist from LA), <a href="https://twitter.com/_kinshukmishra">Kinshuk Mishra</a> (Director of Engineering at Spotify), <a href="https://twitter.com/petesoder">Pete Soderling</a> (successful entrepreneur from New York and Silicon Valley, founder of <a href="https://www.hakkalabs.co/">Hakka Labs</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.dataengconf.com/">DataEngConf</a>), <a href="https://twitter.com/r39132">Sid Anand</a> (former Cloud Data Architect at Netflix who implemented Netflix migration to the cloud that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97VBdgIgcCU">Adrian Cockcroft later on told the World about</a>, former Tech Lead at LinkedIn where he implemented typeahead search, currently Data Architect at <a href="https://www.agari.com/">Agari</a> - company that provides fraud detection services), <a href="https://twitter.com/wesreisz">Wesley Reisz</a> (Solutions Architect at HP and University Professor), and Igor Marvić (Software Engineer at Spotify).</p>
<p>China is very interesting place for developers, especially because of its scale. They have over 700 million Internet users! One developer from <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/">alibaba.com</a> - largest online store in China - told me that during Singles' Day (Guanggun Jie), which is equivalent of Black Friday in USA, they had over 400 million customers online at the same time. This is more than entire population of the United States (~325 million). They also <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/singles-day-alibaba-black-friday/415431/">sold more than $1 billion in merchandise in first 8 minutes</a>! This is SCALE!</p>
<p>While I was in China I was using <a href="https://www.wechat.com/">WeChat</a> (their Facebook equivalent). People don't use Facebook and twitter, as they are blocked by China Firewall. You can workaround it using VPN, but sometimes it works very slow, or not at all. Thus, it is much easier to just use WeChat. When I am in USA I use Facebook, messenger and twitter everyday. However, I noticed that on my iPhone 5S, WeChat works much better than all mentioned apps. It doesn't crash, it's fast, and it has many cool features. Want to add somebody to friends? Just scan they QRCode. You can also shake your phone, and WeChat will try to find closest person who is also shaking their phone, and show on your phone their profile, and on their phone your profile.</p>
<p>Besides the conference, which was very well organized, I was very impressed by how modern the city of Shanghai is. The skyline looks almost like New York City! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Tower">Shanghai Tower</a> (2,073 ft / 632 m) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings">second tallest building in the World</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_World_Financial_Center">Shanghai World Financial Center</a> (1,614 ft / 492 m) is number 9 on the same list, which contains only 1 American building - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_World_Trade_Center">One World Trade Center</a> (number 6 - 1,776 ft / 541 m).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16121" src="/assets/2016/11/shanghai-skyline.jpg" alt="Shanghai - skyline" width="800" height="600" /></p>
<p>It was a great journey, and all Chinese people were very nice for me. I look forward to come back to China in near future!</p>

<p>Earlier this month I had a pleasure to attend Tech Days NL conference in Amsterdam. It was very well organized conference.</p>
<p>I had opportunity to meet with many passionate developers. I met Bart de Smet. He is a C# Ninja who works for Microsoft at Bing Team, but he also C# compiler contributor. If you are C# passionate, like I am, I really recommend you to check out his <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechDays/Techdays-2016-The-Netherlands?sort=sequential&amp;direction=desc&amp;term=&amp;s=Bart-De-Smet#theSessions">talks</a>. I also met <a href="http://www.snowball.be/">Gil Cleeren</a> (author of a few awesome <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/gill-cleeren">Pluralsight courses about Xamarin</a>, and organizer of <a href="http://techorama.be/">Techorama</a> conference), Roy Corneliasen (Xamarin MVP who is building mobile apps while working for <a href="https://xpirit.com/">Xpirit</a>), and <a href="https://twitter.com/techmike2kx">Mike Martin</a> (Azure MVP). Check out their sessions as well! I'm looking forward to meet them again at MVP summit in Redmond this November!</p>
<p>Third time this year I spoke about the Azure Portal Architecture. I had to shorten my <a href="http://jj09.net/azure-portal-the-largest-single-page-app-in-the-world/">VSLive session</a> from 1:15h to 45 mins. So if the VSLive session was too long, and too much of commitment for you, check out my Tech Days session ;) I gave a high-level overview of our architecture, technologies we are using, our deployment approach, and lessons learned over last 2 years: performance tips &amp; tricks, how to avoid regressions, and how to handle them when they happen.</p>

      <h1><a href="/ui-acceptance-testing-accessibility/">UI Acceptance Testing Accessibility</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15761" src="/assets/2016/09/accessibility_keywords.png" alt="Accessibility keywords" width="800" height="435" /></p>
<p>In the previous post <a href="http://jj09.net/unit-testing-accessibility/">Unit Testing Accessibility</a> I showed how to run accessibility check on HTML node with <a href="http://www.deque.com/products/axe/">aXe</a>. This approach can be used to test components of your website.</p>
<p>You can take your accessibility testing to the next level by adding accessibility check for entire pages.</p>
<p>Do you remember <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html">Martin Fowler's testing pyramid</a>?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15771" src="/assets/2016/09/test-pyramid.png" alt="testign pyramid" width="619" height="341" /></p>
<p>While high-level UI tests can detect the same issues that unit tests can, usually UI tests are slower to run. Sometimes it takes 30 seconds to 1 minute to run 1 UI test, while unit test can be run in less than 100 milliseconds. Ideally you should have the most common scenario covered by UI test, and all possible customizations (on the component level) covered by unit tests. You can also add UI tests for some complex combinations of your components, and when you are fixing a bug in situation that unit test cannot cover encountered scenario. Because as you know, while fixing a bug, you should add unit test covering buggy scenario.</p>
<p>In general, unit tests and UI tests should be complementary. UI test should indicate an issue, while unit test should help you to find a source of the problem.</p>
<p>In accessibility testing, high-level checks are very useful in detecting accessibility issues caused by some "small change". Once you detect accessibility violation, you should:</p>
<ol>
<li>narrow it down to particular unit of your website</li>
<li>add unit test to cover broken scenario</li>
<li>make sure it fails</li>
<li>fix the issue (by writing code)</li>
<li>make sure that unit test pass</li>
<li>make sure that end to end UI tests pass</li>
</ol>
<p>Check out Marcy Sutton's article: <a href="http://www.deque.com/blog/accessibility-testing-axe-webdriverjs/">Accessibility Testing with aXe and WebdriverJS</a>. She created sample <a href="https://github.com/marcysutton/axe-webdriverjs-demo">github repo</a> that is demonstrating how to set everything up.</p>
