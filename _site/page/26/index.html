      <h1><a href="/hi-im-jakub-and-i-work-for-microsoft/">Hi, I'm Jakub and I work for Microsoft</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5531" src="/assets/2014/10/blue-badge-public.jpg" alt="Blue badge" width="300" height="401" /></p>
<p>After <a title="Master of Science in Computer Science" href="http://jj09.net/master-science-computer-science/">I got my degree</a> in August I moved to Redmond, WA to start my new job at Microsoft. I work for Azure App Platform Team. My official position is Software Development Engineer (SDE).</p>
<p>It has been a month since I started. So far, my team, work environment, the product and development process are great.</p>
<h3>My team</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5471" src="/assets/2014/10/MS-a-team.jpg" alt="MS team" width="600" height="392" /></p>
<p>My team (which is part of Azure App Platform) is working on the <a href="http://portal.azure.com">new Azure Portal</a>. People in my team are smart. All of them. Moreover, they are really passionate about things they are doing, and they really care. I am working with <a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/">Steve Sanderson</a>, the creator of <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout.js</a> and <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Search?term=sanderson#ch9Search">one of the best technical speakers</a>. The team is very diverse: people from many different countries all around the World, with a quite few girls among them.</p>
<p>My team is working in Agile.  The working culture is generally: "Get the job done". People are in the office usually between 10am and 5pm. Some are coming later, and stay longer, others come early and leave early (there are also people who come early and leave late). If somebody feel the need to focus and don't being interrupted then he/she is working from home, and it is not a problem.</p>
<p>What is the best, I am not implementing some spec written by somebody 5 levels above me. I need to implement an idea, add my contribution, suggest changes etc. When I asked a question what are the expectations from me, my lead and my manager told me that they expect me to suggest some ideas how to make the product better, how we can improve it, and what we are doing wrong. This is exactly what I was looking forward to!</p>
<h3>Work environment</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5441" src="/assets/2014/10/ms-workspace.jpg" alt="MS workspace" width="600" height="577" /></p>
<p>The building I am working in (Microsoft Building 44) is designed for Agile interactions. There are white boards everywhere. We work in Open Spaces (around 15 people per room). <a href="http://officesnapshots.com/2013/01/28/microsoft-redmond-office-design/">Microsoft is changing approach, and moving from private offices/cubicles to open spaces</a>. What is cool, there are 3 conference rooms 'attached' to our Open Space (2 small, 1 big), and if somebody needs to work in peace, he/she can use one of them. If all are occupied (which does not happen very often), there are special 'focus rooms' (with desk and chair) in the building.</p>
<p>I have great machines to work on: <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/workstations/z420.html">HP Workstation Z420</a> (Xeon E5-1650 v2 3.5 GHz, 32 GB RAM, 128 GB SSD + 256 GB SSD + 1 TB SATA) with two 24" monitors <a href="https://pcmonitors.info/dell/dell-u2415-a-1920-x-1200-ultrasharp/">DELL Ultrasharp U2415</a>, and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop">Microsoft Sculpt keyboard and mouse</a>. I have also ultrabook <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/x1-carbon/">Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon</a> (i7-3667U @ 2 GHz, 8 GB RAM, 240 GB SSD). I have <a href="http://www.ergodirect.com/product_info.php?products_id=16556">adjustable height desk</a>, and very comfortable <a href="http://www.haworth.com/home/seating/task/zody-task">Haworth Zody Task chair</a>.</p>
<h3>The product</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5501" src="/assets/2014/10/MS-azure-portal.jpg" alt="MS Azure Portal" width="800" height="385" /></p>
<p>The new Azure portal is a Single Page Metro Web Application. One of the main goals of the new portal is to make it easy for adding extensions. My team is working on the Framework, which is being used by other teams to create front-end for underlying Azure infrastructure. What is cool,  every extension is working as a standalone application in a separate iframe. Extension authors do not need to work with HTML and CSS a lot. They just use controls (e.g. list, combo box or checkbox) created by us, and communicate with them through TypeScript/JavaScript. Update of the view is performed by Knockout.js. Check Justin Beckwith's post about <a href="http://jbeckwith.com/2014/09/20/how-the-azure-portal-works/">the new Azure portal architecture</a>.

<h3>Technologies</h3>

</a> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5561" src="/assets/2014/10/MS-technologies.jpg" alt="MS technologies" width="800" height="223" /></p>
<p>We use HTML5 and <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> for our View layer. LESS is very handy in maintaining big style sheets.</p>
<p>We use <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> (which compiles to JavaScript). Strong typing, and abstraction over JavaScript inheritance (TypeScript classes) is very, very helpful in building large-scale application. To be honest, I do not know how we would be able to maintain the new Azure Portal using raw JavaScript.</p>
<p>Our main JavaScript Framework is <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout.js</a>. This allows us to prepare generic, reusable controls that can be used by other teams without the need of interaction with the DOM.</p>
<p>Our unit test framework is <a href="http://qunitjs.com/">QUnit.</a> For integration tests we use <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>.</p>
<p>We use git for source control management. As Continuous Integration Server, we use <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>.</p>
<p>We have code review process supported by CodeFlow. It is required to have at least 2 reviews before code can be checked-in/pushed to the repository.</p>
<p>Building process is supported by MSBuild.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, we use bunch of other JS libs, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/kriskowal/q">q.js</a>, <a href="http://www.injectjs.com/">inject.js</a>, <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3.js</a>, <a href="http://hammerjs.github.io/">hammer.js</a> or <a href="http://zeroclipboard.org/">ZeroClipboard.js</a>.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>After 1 month I love it! There are many challenges, and interesting problems to solve. I am still new to the project, and I didn't discover it entirely yet. What I can say now, I really like the people from my team, the software development process and work environment in my team.</p>
<p>Probably I will be writing about my work on this blog. Stay tuned!</p>

      <h1><a href="/ios-for-c-sharp-developer-part-4-xcode/">iOS for C# Developer - part 4: Xcode</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>This post is part of the series: <a title="iOS for C# Developer" href="http://jj09.net/tag/ios-for-c-developer/"><strong>iOS for C# Developer</strong></a>. Previous parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="iOS for C# Developer – part 1: Classes and creating objects" href="http://jj09.net/ios-c-sharp-developer-part-1-classes-and-creating-objects/">part 1 (Classes and creating objects)</a></li>

<li><a title="iOS for C# Developer – part 3: multithreading" href="http://jj09.net/ios-for-c-sharp-developer-part-3-multithreading/">part 3 (multithreading)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>C# developers works with Visual Studio. Recently, some are trying to switch to SublimeText. However, I will assume that you, as C# Developer are familiar with VS. To write iOS applications, you need Xcode. I haven't heard about nobody who created an working app in a different editor (more advanced than Hello World).</p>
<p>In this post I would like to provide a few tips that will help you to get started and be productive.</p>
<p>The first thing that is worth to mention is the fact that Xcode is free. You cannot test you apps on the iPhone or iPad before you pay $99 though. You need to be satisfied with simulator.</p>
<h3>Key shortcuts</h3>
<p>For the beginning, remember three:</p>
<ul>
<li>⇧ + ⌘ + O - quick open (equivalent to CTRL+, in VS2013 or CTRL+T in ReSharper)</li>
<li>⌥ + click - jump to documentation (when clicked on class/interface)</li>
<li>⌘ + L - jump to specified line of code</li>
</ul>
<p>This three will definitely help you to get productive at the beginning. You can find more in <a href="https://cloud.github.com/downloads/Machx/Xcode-Keyboard-Shortcuts/Xcode_Shortcuts.pdf">this cheat-sheet</a>.</p>
<h3>Debugging</h3>
<p>In order to debug application in VS, you have to run it in debug mode. In Xcode, when you run the app on emulator it is always in debug mode. Thus, you just need to set the break-point (by mouse click on the line number, like in VS, or by ⌘ + \ shortcut) and run the app (⌘ + R). Once break-point is reached you can step over (F6), step into (F7) or step out (F8).</p>
<p>Very useful during debugging is dumping objects into console with <code>NSLog</code> function:</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">NSLog(jsonString);</pre>
<p>This outputs, e.g., JSON string to the console, which allows you to inspect it.</p>
<p>To get more flavor of debugging, check <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode_Overview/DebugYourApp/DebugYourApp.html">Apple documentation</a> and <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/28289/debugging-ios-apps-in-xcode-4-5">Brian Moakley's blog post</a>.</p>
<h3>Playgrounds</h3>
<p>The latest version of Xcode (v6), which introduce support for Swift language, adds also very handy feature: Playgrounds. It allows you write and test simple Swift programs, without using iOS emulator. Playgrounds are useful especially, when you are testing some complex logic. They are very powerful. You can use them even to test drawing (still without running iOS emulator). To see it in action, check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtZl1_zc3gg">this demo</a>.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Xcode is very nice IDE. Works very smooth, and breaks very rarely. I wish there was more code snippets (like it is in Visual Studio, especially with ReSharper or WebEssentials). Xcode could also adapt rich debugging experience from VS (e.g., inspecting object variable after moving mouse pointer in top of them). I find it hard to work with this IDE on small screen (like MacBook display). To get comfortable, I need at least 22-24". But that is just my opinion. What do you think?</p>

      <h1><a href="/ios-for-c-sharp-developer-part-3-multithreading/">iOS for C# Developer - part 3: multithreading</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>This post is part of the series: <a title="iOS for C# Developer" href="http://jj09.net/tag/ios-for-c-developer/"><strong>iOS for C# Developer</strong></a>. Previous parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="iOS for C# Developer – part 1: Classes and creating objects" href="http://jj09.net/ios-c-sharp-developer-part-1-classes-and-creating-objects/">part 1 (Classes and creating objects)</a></li>
<li><a title="iOS for C# Developer – part 2: strings" href="http://jj09.net/ios-for-c-sharp-developer-part2-strings/">part 2 (strings)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The most typical scenario to use multithreading is to maintain responsive UI when we do some resource-consuming computation.</p>
<h3>C#</h3>
<p>Let's consider simple button click action in C#:</p>
<pre class="lang:csharp decode:true">private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    this.status.Content = "Computing...";
    Compute();
    this.status.Content = "Done";
}

private void Compute()
{
    Thread.Sleep(5000);            
}
</pre>
<p>Method <code>Compute()</code> is a CPU-intensive operation (simulated by <code>Sleep()</code> function).</p>
<p>Above code will block UI during computation. To keep UI responsive, computation has to take place in a separate thread. It can be done easily using <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> keywords:</p>
<pre class="lang:csharp decode:true">private async void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    this.status.Content = "Computing...";
    await Compute();
    this.status.Content = "Done";
}

private async Task Compute()
{
    await Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&gt;
    {
        Thread.Sleep(5000);
    });
}
</pre>
<h3>iOS</h3>
<p>This is equivalent (single-threaded) button click handler in iOS:</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">- (IBAction)buttonClick:(id)sender
{
    self.status.text = @"Computing...";
    [self compute];
    self.status.text = @"Done";
}

- (void)compute
{
    [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:5];
}
</pre>
<p>Multithreaded version is a little bit different. In Objective-C, there is no syntax similar to <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>. Thus, status update has to be invoked by background thread explicitly. Additionally, every UI operation (in this case: label text update) has to be done in the main thread. Below code, use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/ConcurrencyProgrammingGuide/OperationQueues/OperationQueues.html">Dispatch Queues</a>, which is the easiest and recommended way for multithreading scenarios:</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">- (IBAction)buttonClick:(id)sender
{
    self.status.text = @"Computing...";
    [self compute];
}

- (void)compute
{
    dispatch_queue_t queue = dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0);
    dispatch_async(queue, ^{
        [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval:5];
        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
            self.status.text = @"Done";
        });
    });
}
</pre>
<p>This multithreaded code will look pretty similar in Swift.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Invoking background threads is much easier from developer perspective in C#. Code is concise and more readable. Multithreading in Objective-C introduce some overhead, but it is not very hard to handle.</p>

      <h1><a href="/ios-for-c-sharp-developer-part2-strings/">iOS for C# Developer - part 2: strings</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>This post is part of the series: <a title="iOS for C# Developer" href="http://jj09.net/tag/ios-for-c-developer/"><strong>iOS for C# Developer</strong></a>. First part can be found <a title="iOS for C# Developer – part 1: Classes and creating objects" href="http://jj09.net/ios-c-sharp-developer-part-1-classes-and-creating-objects/">here</a>.</p>
<p>String operations in Objective-C are very verbose in comparison to C#.</p>
<p>Let's assume the following string definition for all below examples:</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">NSString *str = @"Some string. Another string.";</pre>
<h3>Concatenation</h3>
<p>I think this is the most common operation. In C# it is very simple:</p>
<pre class="lang:csharp decode:true">string result += " Appended string.";</pre>
<p>* For concatenation in C#, consider using <code>StringBuilder</code> class (if performance matters).</p>
<p>In Objective-C, <code>NSMutableString</code> type has to be used. Thus, if we have <code>NSString</code> created, we have to do the following:</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">NSMutableString *temp = [[NSMutableString alloc] initWithString:str];
[temp stringByAppendingString:@" Appended string."];
str = temp;</pre>
<p>A bit of work, huh?</p>
<h3>Substring</h3>
<p>To get substring from letter 3 to 7 in C#:</p>
<pre class="lang:csharp decode:true">string result = str.Substring(3,5);</pre>
<p>In Objective-C:</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">NSString *result = [str substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(3,5)];</pre>
<p>Pretty straightforward.</p>
<h3>Split</h3>
<p>To split sentences in our sample string in C#, we would do:</p>
<pre class="lang:csharp decode:true">string[] result = str.Split(". ");</pre>
<p>In Objective-C:</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">NSArray *result = [str componentsSeparatedByString:@". "];</pre>
<p>Also, pretty similar.</p>
<h3>Replace</h3>
<p>This operation is much more verbose than its equivalent in C#. To replace spaces with underscores, in C# we do:</p>
<pre class="lang:csharp decode:true">string result = str.Replace(" ", "_");</pre>
<p>In Objective-C:</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">NSString *result = [str stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@" " withString:@"_"];</pre>
<p>Looks pretty the same, but long, custom names preceding actual parameters make code unnecessary long (IMO).</p>
<h3>Real-world example</h3>
<p>Usually we need a few string operations working together. Let's apply above operations together. For example: we want to get only the second sentence from our string with underscores instead of spaces.</p>
<p>In C#:</p>
<pre class="lang:csharp decode:true">string result = str.Split(new [] {". "}, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries)[1].Replace(' ','_');</pre>
<p>In Objective-C:</p>
<pre class="lang:objc decode:true">NSString *result = [[str componentsSeparatedByString:@". "][1] stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@" " withString:@"_"];</pre>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Some of above operations are easier in Swift (e.g., <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24034174/how-do-i-concatenate-strings-in-swift">concatenation</a> looks the same like in C#), but some are still very verbose (e.g., <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24044851/how-do-you-use-string-substringwithrange-or-how-do-ranges-work-in-swift">substring</a>, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24200888/any-way-to-replace-characters-on-swift-string">replace</a>). However, the syntax is more similar to C#. The message passing syntax is something you need to get use to in Objective-C, not only in case of string operations.</p>
