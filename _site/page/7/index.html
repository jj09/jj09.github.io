      <h1><a href="/azure-mobile-app-on-azure-friday/">Azure Mobile App on Azure Friday</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Last month I had a pleasure to talk about Azure App with Scott Hanselman on his show <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Azure-Friday">Azure Friday</a>.</p>
<p>In this talk I presented Azure App architecture, our CI/CD infrastructure and how we took advantage of various benefits we get thanks to building app with Xamarin. Check it out!</p>
<p><iframe src="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Azure-Friday/Azure-Mobile-App-Under-the-Hood/player" width="960" height="540" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>If you want to learn more details about how we built the Azure App, check out my blog post <a href="https://jj09.net/under-the-hood-of-the-azure-mobile-app/">Under the hood of the Azure Mobile App</a>.</p>
<p>My talk was pretty technical. Deep into the meat. However, the same week, <a href="https://twitter.com/flanakin">Michael Flanakin</a> gave high-level overview of Azure App and our future plans:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Azure-Friday/Azure-Mobile-App-Overview/player" width="960" height="540" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Have you tried Azure App yet? </p>
<p>It is available on <a href="http://aka.ms/azureapp/ios">iOS</a> and <a href="http://aka.ms/azureapp/android">Android</a>. </p>
<p>We would love to hear your feedback through <a href="https://feedback.azure.com/forums/568069-azure-app/filters/top">our User Voice</a>!</p>

      <h1><a href="/taking-wordpress-blog-to-https-with-cloudflare-in-less-than-10-minutes/">Taking Wordpress blog to HTTPS with CloudFlare in less than 10 minutes!</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18523" src="/assets/2017/07/Cloudflare-e1500656493331.png" alt="CloudFlare" width="800" height="273" /></p>
<p>Making your website secure has never been easier! I was able to take my WordPress blog to HTTPS in less than 10 minutes!</p>
<h3>CloudFlare</h3>
<p>This part is super easy and straight-forward. Just sign up for <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a>, go to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/a/add-site">cloudflare.com/a/add-site</a> and follow instructions. You can also check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbHN2sk3JjQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2774">this Troy Hunt's demo</a> to see it in action.</p>
<p>Once you finish, your website will be running on HTTPS!</p>
<p>Additional benefit is taking advantage of CloudFlare cache! For free! As you can see on the below screenshot, in last month: 54/66 GB was served from CloudFlare, only 11/66 GB came from my server!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18503" src="/assets/2017/07/CloudFlare-Bandwidth-e1500656134409.png" alt="CloudFlare - cached bandwidth" width="800" height="607" /></p>
<h3>WordPress</h3>
<p>If you have WordPress blog (like I do), above setup will take your website to HTTPS, but all urls (hyperlinks, images, stylesheets etc.) will be still HTTP. This will result in <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/fixing-mixed-content">mixed content error</a>.</p>
<p>I love WordPress because every problem you may have was already solved by somebody else :) In this case problem is solved by <a href="https://jonnyjordan.com/blog/how-to-setup-cloudflare-flexible-ssl-for-wordpress/">CloudFlare Flexible SSL Plugin</a>.</p>
<h3>Multiple domains</h3>
<p>If you have multiple domains pointing to your blog, things are a little bit more complicated: <a href="http://www.itworld.com/article/2936598/servers/wordpress-multisite-ssl-with-domain-mapping-using-cloudflare.html">Wordpress Multisite SSL with domain mapping using Cloudflare </a>.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>If you want to learn more about HTTPS, check out <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/new-pluralsight-course-what-every-developer-must-know-about-https/">What Every Developer Must Know About HTTPS</a>. It is also worth to remember that <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/i-wanna-go-fast-https-massive-speed-advantage/">HTTPS might be faster than HTTP</a>!</p>
<p>Is your website secure? Why not?</p>

      <h1><a href="/quick-intro-to-web-development-with-typescript-webpack-and-aurelia/">Quick intro to web development with TypeScript, webpack and Aurelia</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p><img src="/assets/2017/06/seattlejs_typescript-785x442.jpg" alt="TypeScript at SeattleJS" width="785" height="442" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-18283" /></p>
<p>Earlier this month I spoke at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/seattlejs/events/237924502/">SeattleJS meetup</a>. I love this meetup! People attending it are awesome! Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/codefoster">Jeremy Foster</a> for inviting me to speak! If you are living in Seattle area you should definitely <a href="https://www.meetup.com/seattlejs/">check it out</a>!</p>
<p>I gave fast-paced 30 mins overview of TypeScript. I showed a sample app that is taking advantage of <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a> for continuous compilation, bundling and minification. I also did quick demo of <a href="http://aurelia.io/">Aurelia Framework</a> &lt;3</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gdefBVf1lMI?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After presentation I got a lot of questions about migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript, and about specifics of building large web apps.</p>
<p>TypeScript team and Anders Hejlsberg shared with me a few interesting reads about migrating to TypeScript:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://slack.engineering/typescript-at-slack-a81307fa288d">TypeScript at Slack</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.eternalcoding.com/?p=103">Why we decided to move from plain JavaScript to TypeScript for Babylon.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@tomdale/glimmer-js-whats-the-deal-with-typescript-f666d1a3aad0">Glimmer.js: What’s the Deal with TypeScript?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also found out that Visual Studio Code was initially written in TypeScript, and before v1 release they switched to TypeScript.</p>
<p>Do you have questions or thoughts about migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript? Join discussion on <a href="https://twitter.com/JakubJedryszek/status/875032093134172160">twitter</a>.</p>
<p>To learn more about specifics of building large web apps, check out my talk from Ignite Australia I gave earlier this year:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/Australia-2017/ARC122/player" width="960" height="540" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>At the same conference, I gave a longer version of the talk I did at the meetup. So if you want to dive in deeper, the video is <a href="https://jj09.net/ignite-australia-2017/">here</a>.</p>
<p>It is also worth to mention that TypeScript is getting more, and more traction every day. If you are web developer you should seriously consider using it over pure JavaScript, or transpiled JavaScript vNext. </p>
<p><code>TypeScript = JavaScript vNext + types</code></p>
<p>Every valid JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code. Thus, by choosing TypeScript you have flexibility to use JavaScript, and opportunity to add type checks to some critical components of your project.</p>

<p><strong>Once more, thanks SeattleJS for organizing awesome meetup and inviting me to speak! Great meetup, great people, keep up good work!</strong></p>

<p>For last 6 months I've been working on <a href="https://thenextweb.com/dd/2017/05/10/microsoft-announces-new-azure-mobile-applications-android-ios/">the Azure Mobile App</a> for iOS and Android. We officially announced it at Microsoft's <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/">//build</a> conference keynote last month.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKK_XHMFE3U?start=594&amp;end=639" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Now, you can monitor your Azure Resources from your phone! You can also take quick management actions, like start/stop/restart. Actually, you can do whatever you want using Cloud Shell that enables you to execute any command available through Azure CLI and PowerShell.</p>
<p>To learn more about the app functionalities, check out <a href="https://twitter.com/flanakin">Michael Flanakin</a>'s blog post: <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-app-preview/">Introducing the Azure app public preview</a>.</p>
<h3>Xamarin</h3>
<p>The app is built with Xamarin Native in C#. To learn more about Xamarin, checkout my blog post <a href="https://jj09.net/getting-started-with-xamarin-in-2016/">Getting started with Xamarin in 2016</a>.</p>
<p>The great thing about Xamarin Native apps is the fact that you can do everything what is possible when building native iOS apps with swift and native Android apps with Java. You can take any code sample in swift or Java, translate it to C# and use in your Xamarin app. Additionally, you can share code across platforms. We have around 60-70% code share. Most of our code is shared using PCL (Portable Class Library). Some components are in Shared Project.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18131" src="/assets/2017/06/AzureMobileSolution.png" alt="Azure Mobile Solution" width="532" height="422" /></p>
<h3>Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery with VSTS and Hockey App</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/">VSTS</a> provide awesome tools for customizing build params, running tests, and deploying with <a href="https://www.hockeyapp.net/">HockeyApp</a>. What's more, when you are publishing your alpha/beta builds with <a href="https://www.hockeyapp.net/">HockeyApp</a> you get auto-update notifications for free.</p>
<p>We have 3 environments:</p>
<ul>
<li>alpha - deployed on every commit if tests are passing (used by team members)</li>
<li>beta - deployed after merge from alpha branch if all tests are passing (available for all Microsoft employees - it allows us to test the next release candidate)</li>
<li>App Store / Google Play - deployed manually (Apple does not provide mechanism to auto-deploy and we are working on automating Google Play deploy from VSTS)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Build definitions</h4>
<p>I blogged about <a href="https://jj09.net/continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-for-xamarin-ios-with-vsts/">setting up VSTS for Xamarin.iOS</a> earlier this year. Configuring Android build is much easier. Our VSTS build pipelines for iOS and Android look like below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17751" style="float: left; margin: 10px;" src="/assets/2017/06/VSTS-ios.png" alt="VSTS Xamarin.iOS build definition" width="400" height="832" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17781" style="margin: 10px;" src="/assets/2017/06/VSTS-droid-1.png" alt="VSTS - Xamarin.Droid build definition" width="400" height="1003" /></p>
<p>The general scenario is:</p>
<ul>
<li>build in <em>Debug</em> mode (in order to initialize TestCloud, which I described in <a href="https://jj09.net/continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-for-xamarin-ios-with-vsts/">this blog post</a>)</li>
<li>run tests</li>
<li>build in <em>Release</em> mode (without TestCloud init code)</li>
<li>deploy to HockeyApp</li>
</ul>
<p>We are thinking about running tests in <em>Release</em> mode (it requires passing <em>TEST_CLOUD</em> build param to build command explicitly). This will give us the same app that later on will be deployed to HockeyApp. A few times we had situations when app was working fine in <em>Debug</em> mode and all UI tests were passing, but it was crashing on startup in Release mode. In this case, if somebody updated app on their device, they had to uninstall it, and install manually again after we fixed bug causing crash. Very inconvenient.</p>
<h4>Storing secrets</h4>
<p>VSTS provides mechanism to keep your secrets (passwords and tokens) outside of your source code. You can store them in <em>Variables</em> tab in your build definition. Notice small lock next to secret value. Once you click it, it will hide the secret forever. There is no way to read it back from VSTS. I've done this a few times, and had to regenerate keys and tokens. You can store your secrets in <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/">Azure KeyVault</a>, where they are always readable.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17851" src="/assets/2017/06/VSTS-variables.png" alt="VSTS - variables" width="1868" height="800" /></p>
<p>When you are running UI tests, usually you need to authenticate (AKA you need password to login with your test account). There is no way to pass password as parameter to Test Cloud, but there is a workaround: we have file <em>Password.txt</em> in UI test project (without password of course), and before running UI tests, we run shell script that takes password (from VSTS <em>Variables</em>) as parameter and writes it to the Password.txt file. You can pass variables stored in VSTS as arguments to VSTS tasks.</p>
<p>This is shell script:</p>

      <h1><a href="/the-clean-coder-a-code-of-conduct-for-professional-programmers/">The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16961" src="/assets/2017/04/The-Clean-Coder-Robert-C.-Martin.jpg" alt="The Clean Coder (Robert C. Martin)" width="260" height="337" /></p>
<p>You are probably familiar with Uncle Bob's classic: <a href="http://amzn.to/2pEQMv9">Clean Code</a>. While <a href="http://amzn.to/2pEQMv9">Clean Code</a> is about good engineering practices, and writing good code, <a href="http://amzn.to/2otsMcG">The Clean Coder</a> is more about communication aspect of developer's work. It's about how to behave professionally, be disciplined, and stick to good coding practices. What's more, it demonstrates how to avoid common pitfalls in software development process. Such as underestimating time, undergo management pressure or cutting corners (AKA writing bad code).</p>
<p>In <a href="http://amzn.to/2otsMcG">Clean Coder</a>, Uncle Bob is explaining by example how to communicate at work. Don't try to be just a "nice guy". Be professional and responsible, while being polite. There is nothing worse than giving false promises just to make others happy. However, I have an impression that a lot of people are able to get away with that.</p>
<p>Does below sounds familiar to you?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16971" src="/assets/2017/04/CleanCoder_Story.png" alt="Clean Coder - rush to complete" width="642" height="1667" /></p>
<p>Do you remember a situation when you thought: "Damn, I wish I <b>didn't</b> add this test. I would save a day"? What about situation like: "Damn, I wish I <b>did</b> add that test. It would cost me 1 day, but I would save 2 days I spent fixing the bug this test would guard against"? I'll let you to deal with the answer.</p>
<p>If you don't want to read entire book, read first 3 chapters. It is a great summary and advice on common wrong doing of most programmers that is not caused by their lack of proficiency, but rather not sticking to their professionalism and discipline.</p>
<p>Ohh...and if you have never heard about Uncle Bob checkout <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vx0jNFW0uJA&amp;list=PLcr1-V2ySv4Tf_xSLj2MbQZr78fUVQAua">Every Uncle Bob Robert C Martin Video playlist on youtube</a>, his <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/">blog</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID principles</a>. Uncle Bob is like your doctor who is telling you that you should eat healthy and exercise regularly. He has similar advises, but about how you should write code.</p>
<p><a href="http://amzn.to/2otsMcG">The Clean Coder</a> is definitely one of the best books I've read about Software Development, and I'm adding it to my <a href="http://jj09.net/books/">favorites</a>.</p>
<p>Are you developer? What are your thoughts? Does some situations described in this book happened for you? Maybe you are business person? What do you think? Leave a comment!</p>
