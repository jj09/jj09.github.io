        <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16851" src="/assets/2017/02/Ignite_Australia_2017.png" alt="Microsoft Ignite Australia 2017" width="800" height="405" /></p>
<p>This month I had a pleasure to speak at Microsoft Ignite conference in Australia.</p>
<h3>My talks</h3>
<p>I updated my talk about the Azure Portal with more performance tips &amp; tricks, and one of the most important thing I learned while working with the Azure Portal Team: the Data Driven Approach for making decisions and improving product.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/Australia-2017/ARC122/player" width="960" height="540" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I got very positive outcome during and after my session:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16701" src="/assets/2017/02/Ignite_PortalTalk_Recommendation.png" alt="Azure Portal talk recommendation" width="574" height="99" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also updated my TypeScript talk with <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/">yarn</a> (faster and better <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a>), and <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a> (module bundler that can also compile TypeScript to JavaScript, minify it, optimize it and much more).</p>
<p><iframe src="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/Australia-2017/OPEN226/player" width="960" height="540" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After my talks I've been interviewed by <a href="https://twitter.com/dunchunter">Duncan Hunter</a> on Azure Portal and Building Large Scale Web Apps with TypeScript:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEHLRQD2EO0?ecver=1" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Microsoft Ignite Australia was very well organized conference. I had a pleasure to meet a lot of passionate and curious people there. If you are a speaker or developer looking for a good conference, I strongly recommend you to go. If you are not from Australia, don't forget to take melatonin for 14h+ flight :) Oh, and the location is great too!</p>

51. Avoid Waterfall career planning.<br />
52. Be better every day.<br />
53. Try to go independent (e.g. 2 hours/day after work hours) - how much did you earn?</p>

      <h1><a href="/hockeyapp-vsts-generate-release-notes-from-last-git-commit-message/">[HockeyApp + VSTS] Generate release notes from last git commit message</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Continuous Integration and Continuous delivery for Xamarin apps with VSTS and HockeyApp is awesome!</p>
<p>I blogged about <a href="http://jj09.net/continuous-integration-and-continuous-delivery-for-xamarin-ios-with-vsts/">setting up CI/CD pipeline with VSTS+HockeyApp</a> a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>If you want to add release notes to HockeyApp release you have two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add release notes manually, by setting 'Release Notes' property, and update them before every build (AKA - option that sucks)</li>
<li>Add path to release notes file, by setting 'Release Notes (file)' property, and update it before every git push (AKA - option that sucks less)</li>
<li>Add path to release notes file, by setting 'Release Notes (file)' property, and generate release notes from last git commit message on every build (AKA - option that rocks)</li>
</ol>
<p>Applying options 1 and 2 is easy.</p>
<p>To make option 3 happen you need to add script that will get last git commit message, and output it to the file that you specified in 'Release Notes (file)' property. This script should be executed before 'Deploy to HockeyApp' step (of course).</p>
<p>For Xamarin.iOS you need to add 'Shell Script' task that can look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"last commit: </span><span class="nv">$BUILD_SOURCEVERSIONMESSAGE</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> commit.txt</code></pre></figure>

<p>*it will output file to the same directory where shell script is located</p>
<p>For Xamarin.Droid and Windows builds, you can create <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38199473/how-to-retrieve-git-commit-id-and-message-in-vsts-tfs-build/38200972">PowerShell script</a>.</p>

      <h1><a href="/predicting-future-with-fsharp-and-azure-machine-learning/">Predicting future with F# and Azure Machine Learning</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Earlier this year I blogged about <a href="http://jj09.net/getting-started-with-fsharp/">StockEstimator</a> - my side project for predicting future stock prices. Recently in addition to F# module, which estimates future prices, I added Web Service that takes advantage of Azure Machine Learning to do the same much faster.</p>
<p>Last month I talked about my project at .NET Developers Association Meetup in <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NET-Developers-Association-Eastside/events/232442945/">Redmond</a> and in <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NET-Developers-Association-Westside/events/234174501/">Seattle</a>. I streamed both session with YouTube live, and recordings are already available:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/48bYF2ujpbg" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zXycZslDzfw" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Both videos cover the same topics. Not sure, which one is better. However, there was one gentleman who went to both my talks and he said that the second one was better :)</p>
<p>In both presentations I do a quick intro to F#, an overview of Machine Learning, and how I took advantage of both to predict future stock prices.</p>
<p>If you are interested in F# I recommend you to check my <a href="http://jj09.net/getting-started-with-fsharp/">Getting started with F#</a>.</p>
<p>Presentation slides are available <a href="https://slides.com/jakubjedryszek/f-and-azure-machine-learning/">here</a> (you can find there a lot of references to materials about F#, Machine Learning and Azure Machine Learning).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jj09/StockEstimator">StockEstimator</a> project is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/jj09/StockEstimator">github</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not going to stop here. As you can see on my slides, and at the end of my presentations I have future plans to evolve this overnight project :)</p>
