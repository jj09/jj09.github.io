      <h1><a href="/moving-wordpress-blog-azure-webio-hosting/">Moving WordPress blog to Azure from Webio hosting</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1441" src="/assets/2014/04/azure_logo.jpg" alt="Microsoft Azure" width="400" height="200" /></p>
<p>I decided to move my blog from hosting on <a href="http://webio.pl">Webio.pl</a> to Microsoft Azure (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2014/03/25/upcoming-name-change-for-windows-azure.aspx">formerly Windows Azure before March, 25th 2014</a>). Why? To get more familiar with the Cloud and especially Azure.</p>
<p>I did my migration following <a href="http://www.davebost.com/">Dave Bost's</a> series <a href="http://www.davebost.com/2013/07/10/moving-a-wordpress-blog-to-windows-azure-part-1">Moving a WordPress Blog to Windows Azure</a>:</p>

</ul>
<p>However, not everything went smoothly and easy. Additionally, I adjusted some steps to my needs/settings/plugins/hosting(Webio).</p>
<h3>Small adjustments</h3>
<p>Instead of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/avkashchauhan/archive/2012/06/19/windows-azure-website-uploading-downloading-files-over-ftp-and-collecting-diagnostics-logs.aspx">connecting through FTP to copy content (uploads/themes/plugins)</a>, I used <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/">UpdraftPlus</a> plugin. Moreover, I am using it for weekly backups all the time. It is really nice, especially the cloud backup option, which allows me to put backup files into my Dropbox automatically.</p>
<p>To <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Backing_Up_Your_Database">export my database</a> I used phpMyAdmin provided by Webio. As <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/portable-phpmyadmin/description/">Portable phpMyAdmin</a> plugin is no longer available, I took advantage of <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/adminer/">Adminer</a> plugin to import database on Azure. Another option is to <a href="http://ruslany.net/2012/12/phpmyadmin-on-windows-azure-web-sites/">install phpMyAdmin on Azure</a>.</p>
<p>I am using <a href="http://themify.me/themes/itheme2">iTheme2</a> template, which allows to export customized settings (iTheme2/import tab). After migration, you can easily import it going to the same place.</p>
<p>I had bunch of themes installed. I was testing/experimenting with them <a href="http://jj09.net/hello-world/">when I started my blog</a>. It took me a while to find a way to remove installed theme. You need to go to Appearance/Themes, click on theme you want to remove and then click delete button in right, bottom corner. I deleted all themes, but my current one (iTheme2) and Twenty-* themes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1501" src="/assets/2014/04/wordpress_delete_theme.png" alt="WordPress - Delete theme" width="600" height="422" /></p>
<h3>Webio specific</h3>
<p>Specific for any hosting provider is setting the custom domain. In order to do that on Webio, you need to go to Domains/Edit DNS entries (in polish: Domeny/Edytuj wpisy w strefie DNS tej domeny). In the image below, there are DNS entries for my domain. Only highlighted entries matters for redirecting domain to Azure:</p>
<p><a href="http://jj09.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/webio_dns_settings.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1491" src="/assets/2014/04/webio_dns_settings-785x451.png" alt="Webio DNS settings" width="785" height="451" /></a></p>
<p>When you add domain entries in Azure you need to add www.* entry separately (in my case: jj09.net and www.jj09.net). More details can be found <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-custom-domain-name/">here</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1481" src="/assets/2014/04/azure_manage_custom_domains.jpg" alt="Azure - manage custom domains" width="644" height="396" /></p>
<p>Remember to create/update web.config file, in order to make your custom domain and permalinks (if you use them) working correctly (as mentioned in <a href="http://www.davebost.com/2013/07/11/moving-a-wordpress-blog-to-windows-azure-part-5-moving-from-a-subfolder-to-the-root">part 5</a> of <a href="http://www.davebost.com/2013/07/10/moving-a-wordpress-blog-to-windows-azure-part-1">Dave Bost's tutorial</a>):</p>

			&lt;/rules&gt;<br />
		&lt;/rewrite&gt;<br />
	&lt;/system.webServer&gt;<br />
&lt;/configuration&gt;[/xml]</p>
<h3>Issues</h3>
<p>When I was trying to set <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-send-email-in-wordpress-using-the-gmail-smtp-server/">SMTP server to my gmail</a> I received following email from Google, after try to send test email:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1511" src="/assets/2014/04/GoogleHijackWarning.png" alt="Google hijack warning" width="576" height="463" /></p>
<p>After following steps in provided link, the issue was fixed. There is one interesting thing: I set region for my website to WestUS. However, Google says: "Location: Spain". Hmm...</p>
<p>Another issue I had was getting 404 error on .woff file (<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/crayon-syntax-highlighter/">Crayon Syntax Highlighter</a> plugin font file). I solved it, by modifying web.config file as described <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4015816/why-is-font-face-throwing-a-404-error-on-woff-files">here</a>.</p>
<p>I had also problem with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/only-tweet-like-share-and-google-1/">Tweet, Like, Google +1 and Share</a> plugin. It dosn't display buttons on home page. I tried some tricks (deactivate, re-install) to solve it, but I didn't succeed.</p>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>For hosting on <a href="http://webio.pl">Webio.pl</a> I was paying around $20/year (<a href="https://www.webio.pl/hosting-asp-net/plan-startowy.html">start plan</a>). On Azure, I will need to pay at least $10/month for shared instance (required to have domain <a href="http://jj09.net">jj09.net</a>), which is $120/year. 6x more expensive! Am I crazy? No. As I stated at the beginning, I want to play with Azure. When I decide I am done with that, I can always go back to <a href="http://webio.pl">Webio.pl</a> or some other hosting.</p>
<p>After one week, my estimated bill is  2,07 €.</p>

      <h1><a href="/freertos-jump-start/">FreeRTOS Jump Start</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>In this semester I am taking Real-Time Systems course. In one of the programming assignments, we had to develop program for embedded device <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/ek-tm4c123gxl">Tiva C Series LaunchPad TM4C123G</a>. It is a low-cost evaluation platform for ARM Cortex-based microcontrollers from Texas Instruments. It is very nice board if you want to start with embedded devices. It cost only <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/TI-Cortex-M4-EK-TM4C123GXL-TM4C123G-LaunchPad-Evaluation-Board-/181298354391">$25 on eBay</a>. You can connect it to your computer using USB. Finally, the board has key feature of embedded device for beginners: the LED. </p>
<p><img src="/assets/2014/04/TITivaLaunchpad.jpg" alt="Tiva LaunchPad" width="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1272" /></p>
<p>A typical process-control system can be divided into four types of components: the process, sensors, actuators, and controller (see Figure below). LED allows you to mock your target actuator. Majority of operations performed by embedded devices is control of the actuators. What is nice about LED: it is cheap and easy to control whether and how it is working.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2014/04/safety-critical-loop.gif" alt="safety critical loop" width="540" height="297" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1274" /></p>
<h3>Code Composer Studio</h3>
<p>As a development environment for Tiva C Series I recommend you <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/ccstudio">Code Composer Studio</a>. It is Eclipse based IDE, which makes development easy. Especially for beginners. Tutorial for installation and running first program on Tiva TM4C123G board using Code Composer Studio can be found <a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Tiva_TM4C123G_LaunchPad_Blink_the_RGB">here</a>. I recommend to follow the "Single Download" option (download 1GB+ file). More precisely, download and install: "EK-TM4C123GXL-CCS: TivaWare for C Series and Code Composer Studio for the Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad" <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/sw-ek-tm4c123gxl">available on this website</a>. I wasted a lot of time trying to install it following "Individual Downloads" instructions (download &lt;1MB file). Installer was hanging, when it was downloading files form the Internet and never recovers. In "Single Download" most of files are already downloaded along with the installer.</p>
<h3>FreeRTOS</h3>
<p>FreeRTOS is one of the most popular Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS). Additionally, it is free. This is where its name comes from (<b>free</b> + <b>R</b>eal <b>T</b>ime <b>O</b>perating <b>S</b>ystem = FreeRTOS). The System is written in C language. Thus, we write programs for it in C as well. More details can be found on <a href="http://www.freertos.org/">freertos.org</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeRTOS">wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>The cool thing about FreeRTOS is that it enables easy modifications of Operating System. You can modify e.g. scheduler.</p>
<p>Once you have Code Composer installed. You need to install TivaWare software (which includes FreeRTOS). It can be found in previously downloaded package (if you were following "Single download" option) in TivaWare/SW-EK-TM4C123GXL-1.1.exe.</p>
<h3>Running example programs</h3>
<p>The TivaWare software contains examples, which are ready to run. You can find them in the directory, where you installed TivaWare C Series software. In my case (default path) it is: <code>C:\ti\TivaWare_C_Series-1.1\examples</code>.</p>
<p>There is an example project freertos_demo. It makes the LED blinking and allows you to manipulate the colors using buttons (located at the bottom of the board). The project can be found in <code>examples\boards\ek-tm4c123gxl\freertos_demo</code>. It is ready to run. You just need to connect the board to the PC, open the project (import it) in Code Composer Studio and run it in debug mode. Code Composer Studio will automatically port the program into the board.</p>
<p>You can modify the code, and make the LED blinking faster or slower. Colors manipulation is also easy.</p>
<h3>Queues and semaphores</h3>
<p>FreeRTOS supports multitasking. In the Real-Time systems, communication between different tasks are usually implemented using queues and semaphores. It is also the case in freertos_demo program. Buttons send messages to the LED using queues. Semaphores are use to guard concurrent access to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver/transmitter">UART</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.socialledge.com/sjsu/index.php?title=FreeRTOS_Tutorial">This tutorial</a> is very good point to start with FreeRTOS. It describes basics, queues, semaphores and more.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Developing code for embedded devices is usually, more complex than for Web or Desktop. Running, even very simple application is more complex, because it requires more steps. You need to configure connection between your computer/OS and specific device. Then you need to setup many settings, which varies almost among every device. The communication with ports is also different and every device has different set of them.</p>
<p>There are no universal installers etc. Every single device require slightly different setup. Sometimes, you need to spend hours to run simple "Hello, World!" application. On the other hand, it is fun to create some system, which do stuff outside of your PC.</p>
<p>If you are interested in embedded devices, check out my other post: <a href="http://jj09.net/beagleboard-your-personal-computer-smaller-than-your-wallet/">BeagleBoard - your personal computer smaller than your wallet</a>.</p>

      <h1><a href="/spark-ada-programming-language/">SPARK Ada programming language</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Before I joined <a href="http://santoslab.org">SAnToS Lab</a>, I heard about Ada programming language only a few times. I thought it is an ancient language, that nobody is using anymore. I assumed, that only reason why somebody may bother are some legacy applications written 30 years ago. I thought that safety-critical and high-assurance systems are developed in C/C++ or even Assembly language.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<h3>Ada programming language</h3>
<p>First version of Ada programming language - Ada 83 - was designed to meet the US Department of Defence Requirements formalized in <a href="http://www.adahome.com/History/Steelman/steelman.htm">"Steelman" document</a>. Since that time, Ada evolved. There were Ada 95, Ada 2005 and <a href="http://www.ada2012.org">Ada 2012</a> (released in December 10, 2012). Ada is activelly used in many <a href="http://www.seas.gwu.edu/~mfeldman/ada-project-summary.html">Real-World projects</a>, e.g. Aviation (<a href="http://archive.adaic.com/projects/atwork/boeing.html">Boeing 777's Software is written in Ada</a>), Railway Transportation, Commercial Rockets, Satellites and even Banking. One of the main goals of Ada is to ensure software correctness and safety. The picture below, shows what is the goal of Ada: prevent the Developer from introducing bugs into system by rich tooling and language properties.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1199" src="/assets/2014/04/developer_responsibility_in_ada-785x541.png" alt="Ada responsibilities" width="785" height="541" /></p>
<p>Ada does not use curly braces. The code listing below shows "Hello, World" in Ada:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ada" data-lang="ada"><span class="kn">with</span> <span class="nn">Ada</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nn">Text_IO</span><span class="p">;</span> 
<span class="k">use</span> <span class="n">Ada</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Text_IO</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

      <h1><a href="/spell-check-in-sublimetext/">Spell check in SublimeText</a></h1>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>I am working on my Master Thesis using <a href="http://jj09.net/latex-with-sublimetext-and-skim/">LaTeX and SublimeText</a>.</p>
<p>Today, I found out that SublimeText allows you to check spelling. To enable spell-check: click F6 or go to View-&gt;'Spell Check'. </p>
<p>When spell-check is enabled, it displays red squiggles below the misspelled words. By right click on misspelled word you can correct the misspellings. You can also ignore it for all other occurrences of specific word (useful e.g. for Software Projects names).</p>
<p><img src="/assets/2014/04/SublimeText-spell-check-correct.png" alt="SublimeText spell check correct" width="456" height="282" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1192" /></p>
<p>The spell check is performed based on chosen language/dictionary. You get two English dictionaries (en_US and en_GB) along with SublimeText installation. You can find more dictionaries on github repository: <a href="https://github.com/SublimeText/Dictionaries">SublimeText / Dictionaries</a> (check <a href="https://github.com/SublimeText/Dictionaries/blob/master/readme.md">readme</a> for installation instructions). To change dictionary: go to View-&gt;Dictionary.</p>

<p>SublimeText is not only lightweight IDE. It can also serve as nice text editor.</p>
<p>I really like SublimeText and if you are not using it so far you should try it! There is nice series of posts <a href="http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/2014/03/20/sublime-is-sublime-part-1/">Sublime is Sublime</a>. Greg Young describe how to configure and take advantage of SublimeText as .NET developer (from color schemes to run unit tests, through git integration).</p>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>In my <a href="http://jj09.net/multithreading-in-csharp/">pervious post</a> I described basic multithreading constructs in C#. Now, I would like to compare them to conforming constructs in Java. It might be useful for those of you, who has already created some multithreaded applications in Java, and would like to learn how to do the same in C#.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>As we can see, threading constructs in both languages are very similar.</p>
<p>I put all above code in github repository: <a href="https://github.com/jj09/Threading-in-CSharp-vs-Java">Threading-in-CSharp-vs-Java</a>. </p>
<p>Do you think, there are some other fundamental examples, which should be mentioned in this post?</p>
