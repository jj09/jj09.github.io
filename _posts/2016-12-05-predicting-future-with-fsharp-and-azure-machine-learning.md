<p>Earlier this year I blogged about <a href="http://jj09.net/getting-started-with-fsharp/">StockEstimator</a> - my side project for predicting future stock prices. Recently in addition to F# module, which estimates future prices, I added Web Service that takes advantage of Azure Machine Learning to do the same much faster.</p>
<p>Last month I talked about my project at .NET Developers Association Meetup in <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NET-Developers-Association-Eastside/events/232442945/">Redmond</a> and in <a href="https://www.meetup.com/NET-Developers-Association-Westside/events/234174501/">Seattle</a>. I streamed both session with YouTube live, and recordings are already available:</p>

<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zXycZslDzfw" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Both videos cover the same topics. Not sure, which one is better. However, there was one gentleman who went to both my talks and he said that the second one was better :)</p>
<p>In both presentations I do a quick intro to F#, an overview of Machine Learning, and how I took advantage of both to predict future stock prices.</p>
<p>If you are interested in F# I recommend you to check my <a href="http://jj09.net/getting-started-with-fsharp/">Getting started with F#</a>.</p>
<p>Presentation slides are available <a href="https://slides.com/jakubjedryszek/f-and-azure-machine-learning/">here</a> (you can find there a lot of references to materials about F#, Machine Learning and Azure Machine Learning).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jj09/StockEstimator">StockEstimator</a> project is open source and available on <a href="https://github.com/jj09/StockEstimator">github</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not going to stop here. As you can see on my slides, and at the end of my presentations I have future plans to evolve this overnight project :)</p>
