<p>I moved all my domains (<a href="http://jj09.net">jj09.net</a>, <a href="http://jedryszek.com">jedryszek.com</a>, <a href="http://jakubjedryszek.com">jakubjedryszek.com</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://domains.google.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9611" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015/05/googledomains.jpg" alt="Google Domains" width="740" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>I wanted to move to <a href="https://dnsimple.com">DNSimple</a> (like <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/06/moving-from-godaddy-to-dnsimple.html">Troy Hunt</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/150295885065101312">Scott Hanselman</a>), but I have only 3 domains, and with DNSimple I would have to pay at least $64 (bronze plan = $50/year with 2 free domains + 1 domain for $14), or $80/year (with silver plan that offers up to 10 free domains). That was pretty expensive in comparison to my current price at GoDaddy $44.97 (3 x $14.99).</p>
<p>I started looking for other registrars and I found Google, which beats GoDaddy and DNSimple with price definitely: $12/year for domain with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">privacy protection</span> (on GoDaddy and DNSimple you have to pay additional $8/year per domain).</p>
<p>Thus for 3 domains with privacy protection I pay $36/year. On GoDaddy I would have to pay $68.94 (almost twice as much), and on DNSimple - $88 (more than twice as much)!</p>
<p>A lot of people love DNSimple interface. Google Domains UI is also super simple. Try it!</p>
<p>For a while I was wondering, where is a catch, but I didn't find any. <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2014/watch-godaddy-googles-fuss-domain-service-poses-serious-threat-traditional-registrars/">This</a> and <a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2015/google-domains-useful-small-business-owners-useless-many-cases/">that</a> article confirms that Google Domains is a new serious player on the domains market.</p>
<p>What domain registrar are you using?</p>
