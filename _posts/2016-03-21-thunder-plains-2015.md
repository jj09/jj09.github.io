<p>Last year I had a pleasure to attend and speak at awesome <a href="http://thunderplainsconf.com">Thunder Plains</a> conference in Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>I presented <a href="http://aurelia.io/">Aurelia Framework</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jj09/aurelia-the-next-generation-javascript-framework-you-will-love">slides</a></p>
<p>I really liked this conference. Especially, because instead of having more talks that I could count, there was only 15 sessions (selected out of over 300) divided into 3 tracks. Moreover, all speakers were passionate developers, and you could feel this during their presentations.</p>
<p>I had a pleasure to met <a href="https://github.com/jdalton">John-David Dalton</a> - creator of <a href="https://github.com/lodash/lodash">lodash</a>, who use to work at Microsoft for <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/chakra-microsoft-edge/">Chakra</a> team, and now is working for Microsoft Edge team. I really enjoyed his talk on JavaScript performance. I also met <a href="http://getify.me/">Kyle Simpson</a> - the author of <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">You Don't Know JS book series</a> and awesome Pluralsight course: <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/advanced-javascript">Advanced JavaScript</a>. He presented inspiring keynote on choosing simplicity over easiness.</p>
<p>I also attended very good session - Maybe We Should Slow Down by <a href="https://github.com/phated">Blaine Bublitz</a> (author of over 400 npm packages). Blaine was convincing developers to think twice before contributing code, and publish only features they have high confidence about.</p>
<p>The coolest talk of the conference was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEcZ53B2bic">JS in Near Space</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/makenai">Pawel Szymczykowski</a>. I really recommend you to check it out. Pawel, together with his friends built a small space ship, powered by Arduinos and Raspberry Pis, and they are sending them into "Near Space", up to ~100 000 ft altitude (Boeing 737 flies at &lt;40 000 ft).</p>
<p>Actually, I have seen all talks (in person, or on youtube), and all of them were well prepared. There was no single talk about which I could tell that speaker was not good, or not prepared. You can check them out here:</p>

<p>Thunder Plains is community event organized by 3 passionates - <a href="http://www.vancelucas.com">Vance Lucas</a>, <a href="http://www.jesseharlin.net/">Jesse Harlin</a> and <a href="http://amandaharlin.com/">Amanda Harlin</a> - who did a really good job in taking care of everything. Congrats!</p>
