<p>In this semester I am taking the best course I have ever had: <a href="http://compilers.santoslab.org/">CIS706 - Translator Design</a> aka "Compilers". During this class, we are building a compiler for subset version of Java language. Homeworks looks like that: you get requirements and unit tests. Your score depends on number of passed tests. If all passed - you get 100%. </p>
<p>For development we use Java, JUnit and eclipse. To generate parser and lexer we use <a href="http://www.antlr3.org/works/">ANTLRWorks</a>. The workflow is classic TDD style: you run tests, then try to fix bugs (e.g. your grammar) and run tests again. </p>
<p>Yesterday I spent almost 1 hour because I couldn't rerun tests. When I clicked run, they started and...nothing. I needed to terminate, then tried again, but still nothing. Even the fundamental solution for all kinds of problems with your machine - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2F1rFmyQmY">turning it off and on again</a> - didn't help. I was trying to clean and build project, even remove <em>.metadata</em> directory. Still nothing.</p>
<p>Finally, I started debugging JUnit tests and I noticed, that it hangs on call to parser class generated by ANTLR. I removed it, regenerated...and run the tests! What happend? Debbuging in ANTLRWorks (which I did) locks or do some magic with generated files. That means: after each time you debug in ANTLRWorks, you need to regenerate parser/lexer. </p>
