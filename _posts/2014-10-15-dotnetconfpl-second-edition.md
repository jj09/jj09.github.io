<p><a title="The Story of dotNetConfPL" href="http://jj09.net/the-story-of-dotnetconfpl/">The first edition of dotNetConfPL</a> was pretty successful, and together with <a href="http://mfranc.com">Michal</a> and <a href="http://pawel.sawicz.eu">Pawel</a> we decided to do a <a href="http://dotnetconf.pl/">second edition</a>. This conference is in Polish language, which makes it unique, because there are no other online conference like that in Poland.</p>
<p>This year talks looks promising as well. Maciej Aniserowicz prepared second part of his talk about unit tests from the last year, Filip Wojcieszyn will talk about the hottest thing in this year: Roslyn. Jakub Gutkowski prepared a talk about cooperation of MVC in client and server side. Maciej Grabek proposed a talk about BDD, which is getting more and more popular in .NET World. Michał Łusiak (from <a href="http://tretton37.com/">tretton37</a>) will talk about F#. This year, we have a women speaker! Barbara Fusińska will talk about Aspect-Oriented Programming. Another new thing is a non-technical talk: Patryk Góralowski prepared a talk with mysterious title: Talent for 2 dolars!</p>
<p>I really can't wait! All talks sounds very interesting. Remember to buy pizza and beer, and join us on On Air, this Saturday, October 18, 3PM (UTC+01:00, Warsaw Time Zone).</p>

<p>This year we have 6 ReSharper licenses, and 3 NCrunch licenses to give away.
