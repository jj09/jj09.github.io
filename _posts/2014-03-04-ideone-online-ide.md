<p>A few weeks ago, my friend showed me very cool thing: <a href="https://ideone.com/">ideone</a>. It is online Integrated Development Environment for many languages. Of course, it is not that big like Visual Studio, but enough for simple programs.</p>
<p>It is useful for me, when I am on Mac, and I want to test some C# code (but I do not have Mono installed). It might be useful for you when you are on your tablet (e.g. Surface or iPad). Moreover you can use it on your Smartphone! I tested it on my iPhone 4:</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2014/03/ideone-iPhone-run.png" alt="ideone on iPhone - run" width="500" height="333" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1075" /></p>
<p>* Above screenshots were made on my iPhone 4.</p>
<p>What I really like about <a href="https://ideone.com/">ideone</a> is its UI and performance. It is designed to test small pieces of code. You can save your code pieces, share them and fork other users' code! Additionally <a href="https://ideone.com/">ideone</a> supports many programming languages (even Ada!):</p>

<p>In last year, <a href="https://twitter.com/lukaszgasior">Lukasz Gasior</a> recommended online IDEs for Web Developers to test HTML/CSS/JS and collaborate. You can check them here: <a href="http://www.awwwards.com/10-html-css-online-code-editors-for-web-developers.html">10 HTML & CSS Online Code Editors for Web Developers</a>. Most of them are not that lightweight (need to register, sometimes pay) and powerful (do not support so many languages) like <a href="https://ideone.com/">ideone</a>. However, some of you may find it useful.</p>
<p>If you know about other online IDEs, let me know in comments! </p>
