<p>Today is my small anniversary: in May 31, 2013 <a title="Hello (blog) World!" href="http://jj09.net/hello-world/">I wrote my first blog post</a>. Since that day I wrote 54 blog posts (this is 55th), which is 1 post per week in average. According to Google Analytics, my blog was visited by 810 users. Is it good?</p>
<p>When <a title="Hello (blog) World!" href="http://jj09.net/hello-world/">I started blogging</a>, this blog was hosted by <a href="http://webio.pl">Webio.pl</a>. Now, <a title="Moving WordPress blog to Azure from Webio hosting" href="http://jj09.net/moving-wordpress-blog-azure-webio-hosting/">it is on Azure</a>. My primary domain is <a href="http://jj09.net">jj09.net</a>. I have also <a title="New domains" href="http://jj09.net/new-domains/">two alternative domains</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>jedryszek.com</strong></li>
<li><strong>jakubjedryszek.com</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This blog helps me to summarize stuff I am working on. Additionally, it helps me to improve my writing. I think I am less anonymous in Passionate Programmers World now. Occasionally I am finding my blog listed on <a href="http://subvert.ca/Blog/windows-blogs">some websites</a>. My post about <a title="Multithreading: C# vs. Java" href="http://jj09.net/multithreading-csharp-vs-java/">Multithreading in C# and Java</a> was listed on <a href="http://regulargeek.com/2014/03/31/geek-reading-march-31-2014/">Geek Reading</a>.</p>
<p>I do not have any specific plans for the second year. I am graduating from Kansas State University in August and I am about to start a new job in September. This, along with moving to a different city will be the biggest challenge in this year.</p>
