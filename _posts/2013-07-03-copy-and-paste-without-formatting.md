<p>When you copy some piece of text e.g. from Web Browser to Word it preserves formatting. Which is sometimes (most of the time) unnecessary. I dealt with it (so far) with paste the text into notepad or url input in the browser and then copy again, and finally paste into destination. In case of Web Browser it was: CTRL+C (from source) -> CTRL+T (open new tab) -> CTRL+V (paste formatted text) -> CTRL+A (select entire text) -> CTRL+C (copy again, now it is not formatted) -> CTRL+W (close the tab) -> CTRL+V (paste not formatted text into destination).</p>
<p>I didn’t do that very often, so it wasn’t big issue for me. However recently I was working on some documentation and I was copying/pasting code from IDE into Word a lot. After n-th time I googled for 'copy and paste without formatting' and I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/122404/how-to-copy-and-paste-code-without-rich-text-formatting">nice discussion on StackOverflow</a>. One of recommended tools is <a href="http://www.stevemiller.net/puretext/">PureText</a>.</p>

<p>It allows to paste text from clipboard without formatting, by WIN+V. This shortcut can be changed in options.</p>
<p>My life is much easier right now. I am able to save around 5-10 seconds per each CTRL+C/WIN+V.</p>
