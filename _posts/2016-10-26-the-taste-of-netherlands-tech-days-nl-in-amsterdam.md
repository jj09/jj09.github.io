<p>Earlier this month I had a pleasure to attend Tech Days NL conference in Amsterdam. It was very well organized conference.</p>
<p>I had opportunity to meet with many passionate developers. I met Bart de Smet. He is a C# Ninja who works for Microsoft at Bing Team, but he also C# compiler contributor. If you are C# passionate, like I am, I really recommend you to check out his <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechDays/Techdays-2016-The-Netherlands?sort=sequential&amp;direction=desc&amp;term=&amp;s=Bart-De-Smet#theSessions">talks</a>. I also met <a href="http://www.snowball.be/">Gil Cleeren</a> (author of a few awesome <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/gill-cleeren">Pluralsight courses about Xamarin</a>, and organizer of <a href="http://techorama.be/">Techorama</a> conference), Roy Corneliasen (Xamarin MVP who is building mobile apps while working for <a href="https://xpirit.com/">Xpirit</a>), and <a href="https://twitter.com/techmike2kx">Mike Martin</a> (Azure MVP). Check out their sessions as well! I'm looking forward to meet them again at MVP summit in Redmond this November!</p>
<p>Third time this year I spoke about the Azure Portal Architecture. I had to shorten my <a href="http://jj09.net/azure-portal-the-largest-single-page-app-in-the-world/">VSLive session</a> from 1:15h to 45 mins. So if the VSLive session was too long, and too much of commitment for you, check out my Tech Days session ;) I gave a high-level overview of our architecture, technologies we are using, our deployment approach, and lessons learned over last 2 years: performance tips &amp; tricks, how to avoid regressions, and how to handle them when they happen.</p>
