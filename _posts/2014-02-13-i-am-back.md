<p>Last two months were super busy for me. The end of semester (with <a href="http://compilers.santoslab.org/">compilers course</a>'s project), applying for a PhD studies, Christmas, New Year's eve in Poland, and a job interview. I will tell you more about all of those things later in separated posts. Maybe not all, Christmas and New Year's eve experience I will keep for myself :)</p>
<p>I am happy that all above is accomplished and I can get back to my routine (programming, blogging, reading books and learning new things).</p>
<p>It is worth to summarize the last year, which was quite successful:</p>
<ol>
<li>I started Master of Science in Computer Science program at the Kansas State University.</li>
<li>I started this blog.</li>
<li>I created twitter account and started using it.</li>
<li>I co-organized <a href="http://www.dotnetconf.pl">dotNetConfPL</a> (with <a href="http://mfranc.com/">Michal Franc</a> and <a href="http://pawel.sawicz.eu/">Pawel Sawicz</a>).</li>
<li>I almost maintained 4.0 GPA (I have 3.8 for now).</li>
<li>I applied for Microsoft Student Partner position, but Microsoft rejected me.</li>
</ol>
<p>The main goals for this year are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Graduate with Master of Science degree from Kansas State University.</li>
<li>Start a new job.</li>
<li>Run <a href="http://www.dotnetconf.pl">dotNetConfPL 2014</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I also would like to finally attend <a href="http://devday.pl">Dev Day</a> conference in Krak√≥w, but I am not sure if I will be in Poland on September 26.</p>
<p>During 'the break' I came up with a lot of ideas. I have 6 drafts for blog posts, 5 topics for a blog posts on the to do list and tons of 'new, cool things' to check out. When you get busy, because of School, work, personal issues etc. - don't worry. Take a break, get all of more important things done and once you get back, you will be more happy and motivated than before.</p>
