<p>Last week I had a pleasure to attend and present the Azure Portal insights at the <a href="https://vslive.com/redmond">Visual Studio Live conference in Redmond</a>.</p>
<p>Throughout the conference, 5 sessions were being presented simultaneously, and 1 session was being streamed live. My session was chosen to be streamed live, and is now available on channel9:</p>

I restructured it, added more demos, and new section with performance tips&amp;tricks that you can apply in your project. I encourage you to check it out!</p>
<p>I received a lot of great feedback after my session:</p>

<p>Now, I am waiting for YOUR feedback. Leave it in comments or tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/JakubJedryszek">@JakubJedryszek</a>. What did you like, what did you not like, what would you like to see that I haven't show?</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this conference. I had opportunity to meet many interesting people with passion in Software Development. From marketing people, through Software Developers, to CEOs and CTOs.</p>
<p>Interesting fact I learned from two gentlemen working as Software Engineers at Panama Canal: <a href="http://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/2013/07/19/how-much-does-it-cost-to-go-through-the-panama-canal/">it cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to cross the Panama Canal once</a>!</p>
