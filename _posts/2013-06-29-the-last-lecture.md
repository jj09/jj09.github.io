<p>Most of people I know doesn't like lectures. I think I have been at 1000 lectures so far. 1 course = ~10 lectures per semester. During my undergraduate studies I had ~7 courses per semester, and 7 semesters. That is 10*7*7 = ~500. Another 500 is conferences, scientific groups meetings and Graduate School courses.</p>
<p>There is one lecture I like the most of them all. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ji5_MqicxSo">The "Last Lecture"</a>Â by Randy Pausch. It is amazing, and I watch it every 1-2 years. I did it again today. Randy Pausch was a professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. A month before giving the lecture, Pausch had received a prognosis that the pancreatic cancer, with which he had been diagnosed a year earlier, was terminal. Despite this, he didn't lose optimistic life approach. His last lecture is about achieving childhood dreams and...you just need to see it! I promise: you won't regret it!</p>

<p>The lecture took place at Carnegie Mellon on September 18, 2007. Randy Pausch died on July 25th, 2008. There is also a <a href="https://amzn.to/3TI73hu">book</a> written by him after worldwide success of the lecture (16 millions views on youtube).</p>
